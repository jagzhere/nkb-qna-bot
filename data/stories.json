    "content": "In the words of Dada, “We all think we are chasing the guru, but really, you see, he is chasing us.”\n\nAll I knew about the hardships of India made me sure I didn’t want to go there, yet in October of 1971 I found myself at JFK Airport with two friends, waiting to board a plane for Bombay. A large crowd of our New York “spiritual” group had come to see us off, or, as I suspected, to make sure we actually got on the plane. We were all three in varying states of panic, wondering what we were doing. Both the panic and the confusion were to intensify a hundredfold when we actually arrived in India.\n\nWe three, like nearly all the group of Westerners we eventually joined around Maharajji, first heard of him through Ram Dass. Yet, though my life totally changed after the night I first heard Ram Dass lecture, I did not feel drawn to go to India. Partially, the mystique of what going to India represented in those days made it seem presumptuous for me to even consider the trip. Nor was it clear to me that the power of the awakening I had experienced was, in fact, a connection with Maharajji—that he could possibly be my guru. We had all heard how difficult it was to find him. And what if he sent me away as he had others?\n\nNow, three years later, I was going to India, but I still hadn’t the temerity to chance rejection—I was going to see some south Indian saints and perhaps later “visit” up north, if there seemed any hope of being received.\n\nComing off the plane in Bombay, we were met by an airline representative (in India, a feat in itself), who advised us that we had reservations on an afternoon flight to New Delhi and that tickets were waiting for us at the counter. This was a stunner, but after a twenty-six or twenty-eight-hour fight we were too dazed to feel more than mild wonder. After all, we were in India—anything could happen here. (This mystery of tickets and reservations to Delhi was never solved in any “reasonable” way.) In Delhi, we thought of going to the American Express office to ask for messages, as we had planned to do in Bombay. After all, since we were here, there must be a message. There was: “Go to Jaipuria Bhavan in Vrindaban. Maharajji expected soon.” It was signed, “Balaram Das.” We didn’t know who that was.\n\nWe learned that Vrindaban was not far from Delhi and that we could get there by an afternoon train. Somehow we never thought of pausing in the relative Westernness of Delhi. The message said go and go we did. We thereby learned the first great lesson of India: Never travel by third-class unreserved coach! It was the equivalent of a three-hour ride on a New York City subway at rush hour, with the addition of sunshine, dust, and engine smoke pouring in the open windows.\n\nEventually, we battled our way off the train at Mathura, and in the glowing dusk of the Indian plain, whose beauty we could not then appreciate, we found a bus to take us to nearby Vrindaban. There we were put down in the large bazaar of what to all appearances was a thirteenth-century village of winding alleys full of people, rickshaws, dogs, pigs, and cows. By now it was dark and most of the illumination came from lanterns in the shops lining the streets. We asked for directions to “Jaipuria Bhavan” in our nonexistent Hindi and were directed first up one alley and then down another. It grew later and the shops were beginning to close. Our panic grew with our exhaustion and hunger, for even if we came upon the hostel we would not recognize it, for every sign was in Hindi. We began to envision ourselves huddling for the night among the cows in some doorway.\n\nThen suddenly approaching us appeared a Westerner—someone whom I’d met the year before in California. In hysterical relief, I threw my arms around him, but he, an old-timer in India, was totally calm in the face of our emotion. Oh, yes, Jaipuria Bhavan was just there, around the next bend.\n\nDuring the next few days, the small Western satsang (community of spiritual seekers) began gathering at Jaipuria Bhavan, awaiting Maharajji’s arrival at his Vrindaban ashram (monastery). Many of them we knew from America, including the mysterious “Balaram Das” whom we’d known as Peter. We heard their stories of Maharajji with relief and anticipation. He didn’t sound so fierce and terrifying after all. Then word came that he was here! The next morning we could go to have his darshan.\n\nI arrived at the ashram a little late with Radha, nervously clutching my borrowed sari and the offering of flowers and fruit. We circumambulated the temple and pranammed (bowed) to Hanumanji, then approached the gate in the wall between the temple garden and the ashram. How well I remember that green wooden door! When we knocked, the old chaukidar (gate-keeper) opened it a crack and peered out at us. Then, as each time afterward for as long as I was in India, I wondered if he would let us in. But he stepped back, pulling the door open for us. I looked through, down the vista of the long verandah along the front of the ashram building. At the far end, Maharajji was sitting alone on his wooden bed. When I saw his great form, my heart jumped so that I staggered against the gate. That first sight of him is still piercingly clear in my memory.\n\nRadha had already rushed through and I ran after her, losing my sandals along the way. It was all so simple and familiar—bowing at his feet, giving the fruit and flowers (which he immediately threw back in my lap), weeping and laughing. Maharajji was bouncing, smiling, and crowing in English, “Mother from America! Mother from America!” During that first darshan, though Maharajji spoke mainly in Hindi, I understood everything without the interpreter who stood nearby. And I recognized the love that had poured through Ram Dass, that had irresistibly drawn me to India: Here was the source.",

Even though I’d never been there, I somehow knew all the turns to make in order to get to where Maharajji was. As I came around the corner he started bouncing up and down and exclaiming all these things in Hindi that totally confused me. I came to him and bowed down at his feet.\n\nHe began to hit me really very hard. I had both a sense of great confusion and a feeling of the most incredible at-oneness that I’ve ever felt in my life. He was so totally different from what I had expected yet so familiar at the same time. At that moment I felt all the suffering, all the pain from the last several years dissolve completely. And though the pain was to come back again in the future, the love I felt at that moment made it all a lot less painful later.",

He took some big apples and kept bouncing them off the Ma’s chest, but she was totally absorbed in meditation. I sat watching, then suddenly Maharajji looked directly at me.

After only two weeks in his presence, I was dearly disillusioned about him and began to wander about India on my own, still hoping to find the one true and pure guru somewhere. Several times in my wanderings someone would tell me of Maharajji and that he was nearby. But I would not go, as I felt no particular pull. Finally I was down near Bombay, still seeking the true guru, when an old friend showed up. He looked so clear and light that before we even spoke I determined to go to wherever it was he had just come from. He had just left Maharajji in Vrindaban. I packed my bags and was gone that afternoon. Twenty-four hours later I was before Maharajji. There were a number of Westerners there. Maharajji did not speak to me but he kept looking very intently at my heart chakra (psychic energy center in the heart area of the body), and what I kept hearing, as a voice within me, was that my search was over. I had come home.",

    "content": "I was sitting for several months in Buddhist meditation in Bodh Gaya. About two-thirds of the way through the second month, this funny-looking little man started to appear in the upper-right-hand corner of my awareness. Every so often he’d smile. I wondered who he was and just watched him come and go. Later I began to suspect that it was Maharajji, whom I’d heard about the year before.\n\nAt the end of the retreat I opened a copy of The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa and a picture of Maharajji fell out. When we finally got to Vrindaban where he was supposed to be, we found the gates of the temple locked. Feeling very sad that I had come all this way only to find the gates locked, I went across the street and sat on the culvert.\n\nAll of a sudden I felt as if Maharajji had come leaping over the wall, for I was completely surrounded and filled with the greatest love I had ever experienced. I burst into tears. People passing by saw this crazy, long-haired Westerner sobbing his guts out. They just looked at me and smiled and continued on.\n\nI didn’t know what was going on, but I had the clear sense of being home. There was absolutely no question that I was exactly where I wanted to be. A month before I couldn’t have imagined such an experience, but here I was, so relieved, so happy. My heart seemed to have burst open.\n\nShortly afterward we were allowed into the temple. Maharajji asked me all the usual questions, like who I was and where I was from and what I did. And then suddenly I found myself bowing, with my head at his feet—and feeling totally right about it. And he was patting me on the head, saying something like, “Welcome, glad to see you made it. Welcome aboard.” All I wanted to do was to hang onto his feet, and I didn’t care at all that this wasn’t in any way consistent with my self-image.",

All these crazy Westerners wearing white clothes and hanging around this fat old man in a blanket! More than anything else I hated seeing Westerners touch his feet. On my first day there he totally ignored me. But after the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh day, during which he also ignored me, I began to grow very upset. I felt no love for him; in fact, I felt nothing. I decided that my wife had been captured by some crazy cult. By the end of the week I was ready to leave.\n\nWe were staying at the hotel up in Nainital, and on the eighth day I told my wife that I wasn’t feeling well. I spent the day walking around the lake thinking that if my wife was so involved in something that was clearly not for me, it must mean that our marriage was at an end. I looked at the flowers, the mountains, and the reflections in the lake, but nothing could dispel my depression. And then I did something that I had really never done in my adult life. I prayed.\n\nI asked God, “What am I doing here? Who is this man? These people are all crazy. I don’t belong here.”\n\nJust then I remembered the phrase, “Had ye but faith ye would not need miracles.\n\n“Okay, God, I don’t have any faith. Send me a miracle.”\n\nI kept looking for a rainbow but nothing happened, so I decided to leave the next day.\n\nThe next morning we took a taxi down to Kainchi to the temple, to say good-bye. Although I didn’t like Maharajji, I thought I’d just be very honest and have it out with him. We got to Kainchi before anyone else was there and we sat in front of his tucket (wooden bed) on the porch. Maharajji had not yet come out from inside the room. There was some fruit on the tucket and one of the apples had fallen on the ground, so I bent over to pick it up. Just then Maharajji came out of his room and stepped on my hand, pinning me to the ground. So there I was on my knees touching his foot, in that position I detested. How ludicrous!\n\nHe looked down at me and asked, “Where were you yesterday?” Then he asked, “Were you at the lake?” (He said “lake” in English.)\n\nWhen he said the word “lake” to me I began to get this strange feeling at the base of my spine, and my whole body tingled. It felt very strange.\n\nHe asked me, “What were you doing at the lake?”\n\nI began to feel very tight.\n\nThen he asked, “Were you horseback riding?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Were you boating?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Did you go swimming?”\n\n“No.”\n\nThen he leaned over and spoke quietly, “Were you talking to God? Did you ask for something?”\n\nWhen he did that I fell apart and started to cry like a baby. He pulled me over and started pulling my beard and repeating, “Did you ask for something?”\n\nThat really felt like my initiation. By then others had arrived and they were around me, caressing me, and I realized then that almost everyone there had gone through some experience like that. A trivial question, such as, “Were you at the lake yesterday?” which had no meaning to anyone else, shattered my perception of reality. It was clear to me that Maharajji saw right through all the illusions; he knew everything. By the way, the next thing he said to me was, “Will you write a book?”\n\nThat was my welcome. After that I just wanted to rub his feet.",

    "content": "It was in London. I was on a bus with many empty seats. Then an old man carrying a blanket got on the bus and chose to sit on the window seat beside me, so that I had to stand up to let him in. This annoyed me somewhat, but as he sat down he gave me such a sweet, gentle smile that I forgot my annoyance and sat thinking to myself, “What a sweet old man.” Before the bus came to the next stop on its route I turned to look at him again—but he was gone!\n\nThe bus had not stopped again since he had gotten on. How could he have gotten off without my standing to let him pass?\n\nLater I went to India on the advice of a friend who had been there, and I saw a picture of Maharajji—it was the same man! I located Maharajji and found out that on the day I had seen him on the bus in London carrying a specific plaid blanket, a woman in India had given Maharajji just such a blanket, which he was wearing that same day.\n\nThe Indians also came to Maharajji with varying degrees of desire and readiness. But for them it was different. They had grown up in a culture in which holy beings abounded, and the parents of most of them had had gurus. For the family, the guru was a combination of grandfather, worldly and spiritual guide, and reflection or manifestation of God. They often treated Maharajji more as a man and less as a God, and yet at the same time they could surrender more easily to him. For them, surrender was not a personal matter of ego as it was for us. In the group of stories about initial meetings described by some of Maharajji’s closest Indian devotees, both the differences of culture and the similarity of opening and love are apparent.\n\nI have known Maharajji since I came into this world. My father and mother were both devotees—my father since 1940 and my mother since 1947. Because our parents were devotees and because he was always being discussed in our family, we were all born devotees of him.",

My boss, a government minister, was already a devotee of Maharajji’s and had offered him this lift. But I was smoking and acting as if Maharajji was just another person. In 1958, after the death of my mother, I was in Bhowali with my father, on vacation. We spent a night in the government rest house there and my father became ill in the night, in much pain. They called the Bhowali doctor who gave him an injection but to no avail. The next day, doctors from Nainital came and said that he needed an emergency gall bladder operation. That same day I went to consult doctors at the nearby TB sanatorium. Preparations were then underway for a puja (ritual of prayer) to celebrate the opening of a small Hanuman temple built by the doctor there who was a devotee of Maharajji. I stayed on to watch. Maharajji arrived but stayed hidden. I grew curious to meet him. I heard that Maharajji had put someone in a trance, so I watched a while from a distance before leaving.\n\nThat evening a messenger from the Nainital bus station came to me and told me to visit a certain Baba Neem Karoli. Since there are so many babas, I dismissed the message. But at night I went to the bus station and inquired as to who had sent this message, but no one knew. This aroused my curiosity even more. I asked where I could find this Baba Neem Karoli and went there. Maharajji said to me, “Your name is so-and-so and your father is very ill.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You thought he might die, but God has cured him. Doctors have told you that he should be operated on. But he shouldn’t be. He’ll be all right.”\n\nMaharajji gave me two or three mangos for my father, which I fed to him and he began to improve. After a few days Maharajji again called me. I went but didn’t touch his feet. I was planning to return to Delhi and Maharajji said, “You’re going to Delhi. You drive too fast. Take your father carefully and he’ll be all right.” This touched my heart and I touched Maharajji’s feet. My father never had the operation and became very healthy, with no relapse.",

He walked in, sat down, and said, “Sadhus are no good.” After that I just became a devotee.\n\nONE OF Maharajji’s closest devotees for the last twenty years gives the following account:\n\nIn 1935 I was on vacation from school and went to Dakshineshwar on a religious pilgrimage. When I reached the place where there were many Shiva temples, a man appeared before me whom I had not noticed to be there before.\n\n“My son,” the man said, “you are a Brahmin? I shall give you a mantra.”\n\n“I will not take it,” I said, “I do not believe in it.”\n\n“You must take it,” he insisted, and so I relented.\n\nThereafter, I faithfully recited the mantra daily.

Around 9:00 P.M., I saw my wife, aunt, and mother going out. I asked them where they were going, and they said just to an adjacent house, that some baba was visiting. One of the fellows with me said cynically, “Does he eat? I can arrange food for him.” (This fellow was a hunter.)\n\nMy wife said, “You should not say things like that.”\n\nIn ten minutes they returned. They reported that he had been sitting in a dirt hut with an oil lamp and had told them to go. When they didn’t go, he said, “Go! Your husband’s Bengali friends have come. Go and serve them tea. I shall come in the morning.”\n\nIn the morning my wife and I went over together. Maharajji was on a small cot in a tiny room.

Why don’t you ask them?”\n\nIn fact she had come with some questions, which she hadn’t even confided in us. But she had made a decision beforehand not to ask the questions herself. She wanted Maharajji to answer them unasked, and she wanted it done in private, so she didn’t speak. She couldn’t answer that she didn’t have questions, but because of her decision she couldn’t ask them. So Maharajji said to her, “You want me to answer your questions without your asking. And you want me to tell you when you are alone. You are putting a sadhu to a very hard test. Tomorrow I will come to your house in Kanpur and answer your questions.”\n\nWe sat there a few minutes more and then he said, “Go!” As we were leaving a doubt came to my mind that Maharajji had just sidetracked us by saying he’d visit us tomorrow and answer the questions.\n\nAt about ten o’clock that evening a message came to our house for a Maharajji devotee who was visiting us. The message was that Babaji (familiar form of Baba) was coming to the devotee’s house and he should return home right away. We accompanied him. As soon as I pranammed to Maharajji, he said, “You doubted my integrity! Never doubt a sadhu—the burden is on him, not on you. You have not to doubt.” I apologized to him. I had indeed doubted. Then he said, “All right, tomorrow I’ll come to your place.”\n\nSo the next morning he came over. As this was his first visit, I really didn’t know what to do. Others told me that nothing is to be done—just provide a big pillow on a bed for him to lean on and offer some food or fruit or milk. He’ll take whatever he feels like. It’s his sweet will.\n\nWhen he arrived I escorted him to the sitting room. He said, “No, I won’t sit there. Let the others sit there; you take me to that small room!” I was surprised and confused, since I did not know which small room he was referring to. He gave a description of the room and walked through the house as if he knew where the room was. I was following him, not leading him, in our house. He went straight to the room and said, “Here I want to sit.” He said, “Call Ma” (my wife). She came, and he then answered all the questions she had in her mind. “Is there any question to which I haven’t replied?” he asked. She had to say that there were no more.",

He would come for darshan but sit outside by the shoes for he felt that was his place. He eventually became head of the Administrative Officer School in Allahabad.\n\nHe suffered from thrombosis. At the end he suffered great agony but kept Ram mantra (repetition of Ram, a name of God) going and was very gay. The superintendent was in tears when he visited him near the end, and he asked, “Should I call your wife and son?”\n\nThe commissioner said, “No, this is not a time of attachment. At this time all I have to do is remember Ram and Maharajji. Good-bye. We’ll meet again.” And he died.",

There were four rooms and Maharajji was in the far room. I went in. The minute I entered, Maharajji said, “Get out, you!”\n\nSo I went out and sat down but wouldn’t leave. I sat for many hours. Finally my friend had to return the car because it was closing time. Although my house was quite distant, I was determined to stay and have Maharajji’s full darshan. Finally someone took pity and said, “You aren’t doing it right. When some people start to go in, you go in with them, and if he throws you out, wait and try again with the next people.” I did so and was twice thrown out. Finally, the third time, Maharajji said, “Come sit here. What is your name and what do you do?” Then he said, “Okay, now go.”\n\nBut I said, “I’m not going. I haven’t had darshan yet. I haven’t had a chance to discuss my problems with you.”\n\nMaharajji said, “Go now and come at 6:00 A.M.” So I went home but I couldn’t sleep, and at 2:00 A.M. I got up and did puja. I was afraid Maharajji would leave before I got there. When I arrived at the house at 6:00 A.M. Maharajji had already left, but they said he would return. After some time he did come back and then Maharajji and I spent many hours together. In fact, the rest of my life has been spent with Maharajji.",

    "content": "A MEETING OF THE SPIRIT\n\nNOT EVERYONE WHO met Maharajji was “opened” or “awakened” at the initial visit. Many came, enjoyed a pleasant visit, and left apparently unaffected. They seemed to have “no business” with Maharajji, that is, they were either unready to be touched so deeply, or the vehicle of the guru or this particular guru was not their way.\n\nBalaram (to a new arrival on the verandah at Vrindaban): “Have you had Maharajji’s darshan yet?”\n\n“I don’t know. Is he the fat one sitting over there?”\n\nTHEN THERE were those who while experiencing no dramatic “zap,” yet responded to some subtle thread that drew them back to Maharajji again and again.\n\nI was astonished to watch the way in which tough people would melt as they stayed around Maharajji.\n\nFOR MANY OF US who were either dramatically opened initially or subtly drawn, the desire that became uppermost in our lives was to be with Maharajji. We had become “devotees,” for when we were with him we were experiencing being “at home” in the heart of God. Little wonder that his presence became so addictive and that we would leave home and go to any lengths to be with this spiritual pied piper who was teaching us to dance and play in the fields of the Lord.\n\nBut to assume that just because you wished to be with Maharajji, you could be, did not take into account the nature of this man’s behavior. He moved about unpredictably. And whenever he stayed in any one place for even a few days, people would arrive in a continuous stream from morning to night. Some came barefoot with naked babies from nearby farms; others came by jet and taxi.\n\nI was standing in the front yard of a humble house in a little village in the hills when Maharajji arrived unexpectedly. I was told to remain outside, so I had the opportunity to watch the people come. They seemed to appear almost out of nowhere, arriving from all directions. They were running, some of the women wiping the flour from their hands on their aprons, others carrying their babies half dressed. The men had left their shops unattended. Some were pulling flowers from the trees as they came to have something to offer …. But they came with an expectancy, with a joy, with a reverence, that could not be mistaken.",

    "content": "True, many wanted something worldly from the “miracle baba,” but beyond that they wanted once again to taste of the nectar of being with him.\n\nMANY OF US vacillated in our reactions to this constant demand upon Maharajji. At one moment we saw ourselves and the other devotees and seekers as so many vultures around a piece of raw meat or like flies crawling over a piece of sugar. At those times we tried to protect him, and often we held back so as not to contribute to the scene.\n\nBut at other times we would realize how totally Maharajji had control of the situation. When he felt that people were, as he put it, “eating his head,” he would simply go into a back room and close the door, or send everyone away, or get in a car and leave without a backward glance. Once, after traveling many months to see Maharajji, we at last found him at a devotee’s home in Delhi. We were allowed into the back room with him for a few minutes and then were sent out to have tea with many others. About fifteen minutes later Maharaijji walked out of the inner room and right by us, not more than two feet from our faces, with not the least turn of the head or signal of recognition. He went to a car in which a driver was waiting, he got in, and the car left for a destination unknown. Such a person was clearly not at our mercy!\n\nSo Maharajji kept continually on the move, in a totally unpredictable fashion. Within a temple compound he would move from place to place, at one moment freely available, while at the next closeted in some room with the door securely bolted.\n\nWere that his only movement, devotees could settle near the temple and just visit each day and wait for the moments when he would appear. But his movement was not limited to a single compound. Rather, he wandered from village to village, from the mountains to the plains, from one end of India to the other, from temples to private homes to jungle ashrams. In the middle of the night he might leave unannounced for a destination unknown. Or he might board a train and be destined for a certain city, only to leave the train at some other station, sometimes so quickly, even as the train was moving, that devotees who had followed him were left behind.\n\nThe intense desire of the devotees to be with Maharajji, combined with his elusive and unpredictable behavior, gave rise to the most intricate dramas of hide and seek, labeled by one waggish devotee as the “great grace race.”\n\nBeing a devotee of Maharajji was like participating in a continuous and unending treasure hunt, limited only by economic resources or family responsibilities. The pot of gold was, of course, darshan with Maharajji. And gold it was! One Indian devotee put it succinctly when he said, “Even sexual intercourse with my wife cannot equal darshan with Maharajji.”\n\nTHE INDIAN DEVOTEES had an intricate communication system that allowed them at least thirty percent of the time to trace Maharajji and know of his whereabouts within a day of his arrival in any town or village. We Westerners were not so lucky, and so we had to use our wits, our intuitions, our cunning—and our unmitigated gall—to get to his feet. Our percentage of success was perhaps not so impressive as that of the Indian devotees, but our style and our dramatic entrances and exits certainly were.",

Well, I won’t be here for long.” Then Krishna Priya climbed in. The chaukidar saw her clambering over the wall and since he didn’t want to take the blame for letting them in, he went to tell Maharajji. The gate-keeper said, “Baba, these people climbed over the wall. I’m sorry. I did the best I could to keep them out.” Maharajji’s initial reaction to the chaukidar’s report was rage: “Get ‘em out! Get ‘em all out!” I got thrown out too. We Westerners shared the guilt among us. We came back the next day for darshan and discovered that overnight the wall had been doubled in height.  \n\nMANY LEVELS—MANY CHANGES  \n\nWHEN YOU FINALLY arrived at the right place at the right time and were told, “Yes, he’s here,” and found yourself seated before him, what was it like? Even the tongues and hands of the gods and goddesses of speech, music, and poetry could not do justice to those occasions. So how could I? Like the blind men with the elephant, each devotee met a different Maharajji.  \n\nWhen Maharajji came out you never knew what to expect. He could do the same thing a week in a row until you’d think, “Well, he’ll come out at 8:00.” Then he might not come out all day, or he might just go into another room and close the door and be in there for two days. You had to learn to expect the unexpected. One day he came out and all he said all day long was “Thul-Thul, Nan-Nan,” repeating these words to himself like a mantra. Days went by like this and somebody finally said, “Maharajji, what are you saying?” And it turned out to be an old Behari dialect, and all it meant was “Too big, too big, too little, too little.” When he was finally asked why he was saying this, he said, “Oh, all you people, you all live in Thul-Thul, Nan-Nan; you live in the world of judgement. It’s always too big or too little.”",

    "content": "People are sitting quietly around Maharajji, concentrating. Maharajji faces the opposite direction of a person when he picks up on a loose thought and then he rolls to face the person. With an expression of annoyance and love, he raises one finger or shakes his fist. If someone is meditating, he tweaks his nose or pulls his beard. He turns to a person and tells her that she is very good. Another he maligns, telling all sorts of bad stories. Again he turns to another and says, “Go. You wicked person!”\n\nAND THE WORDS and apples and tea and silences and laughter were all washed in a continuous river of love that poured forth from Maharajji. The devotees who “knew” were equally as happy with Maharajji’s insults as with his praise, for it was all palpable love and food for the spirit.\n\nWe took our cue in this respect from one of Maharajji’s long-term, trusted devotees, called “Dada,” who served Maharajji with a singleness of purpose that awed us. When Maharajji would compliment him, Dada would say, “Ha, Baba,” meaning, “Yes, Baba,” and when Maharajji would shout insults at him, sometimes upbraiding him from morning till night, he would reply, in exactly, the same tone, “Ha, Baba!” Obviously, fame and shame were one to him, at least when Maharajji was the source. No longer could Maharajji get Dada angry or guilty; over the years it had all been burned out. For Dada, it was all grace.\n\nSometimes Maharajji would talk to one person and everyone else would listen, perfectly content just to be present.\n\nTHERE WAS THE sport of watching the newcomers arrive, skeptical, with questions, and then seeing their hearts gently open and their soft, flowerlike quality emerge under the tender care of the master gardener. We would sit in those groups as Maharajji turned this way and that, attending now to a person at his side and the next moment to a devotee far distant who was just entering the temple; and changing the mood of the group from easy laughter to fierce intensity in a moment and then back again. One felt at such times as if Maharajji was the puppeteer and we the puppets.\n\nMaharajji’s company was very special. He was always natural, like a child, a saint in the traditional manner. He set no conditions nor expected any particular behavior from his devotees. He was rarely affected by the outside. He could converse with half a dozen people simultaneously with a camera held a foot from his face. He had no form. He performed no rituals or puja. He followed no orthodox customs such as ritual bathing. Yet his presence was more than inspiring; it was enlightening. While meditating in or near his presence, even though he’d be talking and joking loudly, one quickly reached the place of clear light, a place difficult to achieve without his grace and power.\n\nTIMELESS DARSHANS\n\nMAHARJJI OFTEN counseled the Indian devotees to sit in silence; just to sit, listen, and absorb. But around Maharajji that was difficult to do, for there was a continuous and compelling drama going on around him: who came, who went; what they said; what food was being distributed; who got to sit closest to him; how he was working with each person; which person he petted and which he yelled at; how he moved about on the tucket. One Indian told us that those of us who did not speak Hindi were lucky, because it kept us from getting too involved. When there was a little silence or when you could detach yourself from the melodrama, you could just bask in the timeless grace of his presence.\n\nThe minute you meet him, if you are ready, he will plant himself within you—the seed.

He had no pretensions, yet nobody could deceive him.\n\nWith the Westerners, the talk usually included a series of routines. With many of them, Maharajji developed special routines, and the particular individual would be called to the front, day after day, to perform the same dialogue. To one young woman he would ask each day the same questions: “What are Indian women like? Why are they good?”\n\nShe would reply each day with the same answer: “Because they are devoted to their husbands.”\n\nTo another devotee he would ask again and again, “Will you marry?”\n\nThe devotee would always reply, “Maharajji, how can I marry? I’m so useless.”\n\nTo another, “What is your name?”\n\n“Chaitanya Maha Prabhu” (the name of a great Indian saint), which Maharajji would then repeat and cock his head appreciatively.\n\nHe had trained us well as performing humans. One devotee commented about all this: “Maharajji had his zoo and we were all inmates.”\n\nAnd then there was arti, the ceremony of light. It is a ceremony for honoring the guru. A flame is waved before the guru, and it is accompanied by a chant that enunciates the guru’s many qualities. Under the tutelage of K.K. Sah (one of the longtime Indian devotees), we had learned the entire Sanskrit chant and how to perform the ceremony in order to “surprise” Maharajji. When we finally performed the arti, Maharajji was seemingly so delighted that he made us perform it over and over again, even though while we did it he talked continuously to one or another of those gathered about him. And from that time on, whenever a new group of Indian devotees came to pay their respects we were trotted out from the rear of the ashram to perform arti (ceremonial offering of light) and thus show how spiritual the Westerners really were. Through these many repetitions we learned much. Initially we had wanted to please and impress Maharajji. Later the prayer became just more spiritual materialism. But through that constant repetition, we came to appreciate how a ritual can take on a life of its own and generate a spiritual power independent of the specific reason for which it is being performed at any one time.\n\nOne of Maharajji’s devotees was eighty years old and very spry, like a mountain goat. One day he came in for Maharajji’s darshan when a young, distant relative of his was also there. The relative pranammed to the old devotee but didn’t get up. Maharajji turned to the elder and said, “If you had money, he’d get up and touch your feet.”",

    "content": "One day I got to the ashram very early and I was just sitting over on the porch. Some man arrived carrying a gun. Of course Maharajji said, “Bring it over. Let me see that rifle.” So the man opened up the barrel and checked the chamber to make sure it wasn’t loaded. Even though it was a shotgun, broken in the middle, he wanted to make sure it wasn’t loaded. Maharajji took it and opened it up, and then he snapped it shut and held it up to his shoulder as you would to shoot it. He played a while, opening it up and snapping it shut, then gave it back to the man and sent him away. After the man had left, he asked, “Why does he carry a gun?”  \n\nI said, “I don’t know.” My standard answer.  \n\nAnd Maharajji said, “He carries it because he’s afraid of things.”  \n\nPURITY OF DARSHANS  \n\nIn the winter of 1971 it started getting very crowded and Maharajji began telling people to go to different places. I was told to go to Puri. He also said I could go and see Goenka (a well-known Buddhist meditation teacher) on the way back. I had been feeling that I really needed to learn something about meditation, so I went to Bodh Gaya and stayed there for forty days. During that time my mind was exceedingly clear, like nothing I’d ever experienced before.  \n\nWhen I came back to Dada’s house Maharajji was there. I don’t know if I was experiencing my love for him in a new way or if my heart was closed. Maybe both. But all I was seeing was a man doing all these different things, and I felt none of that love connection I had felt before. There was a clearness and an openness but none of that emotionality and warmth. I stayed there two or three days and kept waiting for the return of that feeling I’d felt before. And I saw all these people opening in a way that I missed. I prayed to Maharajji and it still didn’t change.  \n\nI decided I’d go to the Sangam (holy place at the confluence of three sacred rivers). While I was there, I prayed that after bathing my heart would open again. And as I was bathing I felt my heart open wide. I got out and everywhere I looked, everything was glowing. I got into a rickshaw to go back to Dada’s house—and I realized that I had no prasad. And the route from the Sangam to Dada’s doesn’t go by any bazaars. We did pass a calendar walla (vendor) with those devotional calendar pictures. I looked at all the pictures but they were so gauche. Just as I was giving up, I looked down at my feet and there on the ground in the dust was a picture of Ram embracing Hanuman, which was so exquisite. I bought the picture and went on to Dada’s house. I was late so I didn’t think there would be time for me to reach Maharajji and present the prasad. But as I came through the door a path opened up right to Maharajji. I was so opened up from the meditation course and the Sangam that I gave the prasad without my ego. It was the purest act I’d ever done around Maharajji. Something was taking place, but I was not “doing” it. I put the picture on the tucket and sat down. Maharajji picked it up and looked at it. Tears started coming out of his eyes, and I started to cry, too. Then he stood up and stormed out of the room, giving the picture to Dada. A few weeks later this picture was up in the Vrindaban temple, right next to the murti.  \n\nThe point of the story is that because I was able to do that selflessly, he was able to accept it fully. At other times I came with all kinds of prasad and I would really want him to accept it in a certain way—and he would hardly look at it. I’d polish up the apples for hours, hold them on the bus, say mantras over them; I was trying to be pure. But this time I wasn’t trying to be pure; the purity was simply there.  \n\nTOUCHING HIS FEET  \n\n“I take the dust from the lotus feet of the guru to cleanse the mirror of my mind.” So begins a sacred ode to Hanuman. Touching, holding, rubbing the guru’s feet has always had profound significance in the Hindu tradition. For out of the guru’s feet comes the spiritual elixir, the soma, the nectar, the essence of the sacred Ganges River—the subtle pran, or energy that heals and awakens. To touch the feet of such a being is not only to receive this grace, but it is an act of submission, of surrender to God, for that is what the guru represents on earth.  \n\nBut for those of us around Maharajji, the theories connected with the spiritual value of touching the guru’s feet had little if anything to do with the matter. Rather it was the strangest pull of the heart. A mother, who with her husband had come to India from the United States out of concern for the well-being of her son who was deeply devoted to Maharajji, stayed on for some time. At the conclusion of her visit she reports the following:  \n\nThen as the time came that we had to return to the States, I began thinking about the last darshan I would have. I realized that I really wanted to touch Maharajji’s feet. I didn’t know why I wanted to but I did. I figured that if I went ahead and did it, it would upset my husband, but I thought, “So it upsets him. It is still my decision!” At my last darshan I touched Maharajji’s feet.  \n\nTo my surprise so did my husband!",

    "content": "How vividly I recall, after my first meeting with Maharajji, how all my disdain and arrogance disappeared before an almost overwhelming desire literally to be at his feet. It was perhaps the second or third visit with Maharajji when the opportunity presented itself. I was watching the man next to me. The expression on his face suggested that he was experiencing waves of rapture, and as I watched him out of the corner of my eye I felt jealous. We sat next to each other, cross-legged, before a large, heavy chest-high wooden table. The man, the principal of a school in the vicinity, was probably in his late fifties. He was dressed in a heavy woolen suit with socks (his shoes had been left outside the door of the temple), a tie, a muffler, and, in the fashion common to the men of the hill country in this late November, a woolen hat. Before us, sitting on the table cross-legged, was Maharajji, well-wrapped in a bright plaid blanket, so that only his head showed above the blanket and a bare foot stuck out beneath. It was this foot that was the source of both the rapture and the jealousy, for the man was massaging the foot with great tenderness and love, and I was yearning to be in his place. How bizarre to find myself sitting in a tiny Hindu temple halfway around the world, jealous because I could not rub an old man’s foot!\n\nAs I reflected on this strange turn of events, Maharajji talked now to one and now to another of the twenty or so people gathered in the small room at the back of the temple compound. He spoke in Hindi, which I did not understand, but he seemed to be asking one a question, scolding another, joking with a third, and giving instructions to a fourth. In the midst of these conversations I saw him move ever so slightly, and his other foot appeared beneath the blanket just beside me.\n\nI suspected that only people who had been around him for some time were allowed to massage his feet—and I was the newest comer—but I decided I couldn’t be faulted for trying. So slowly my hands went up and touched the foot and began to massage. But instead of waves of bliss, my mind was full of the sharp edges of doubt and confusion as to whether I should use my fingers or my palms. Just as suddenly as the foot appeared, it was withdrawn back under the blanket. My mind was filled with self-recrimination about my own impurity.\n\nAs the visit went on, Maharajji took me more and more out of my self-consciousness and into a space that had no familiar boundaries. I was experiencing waves of confusion, bordering on hysteria. And that was the moment the foot reappeared before me. And again I reached for it. But this time my mind was too overwhelmed to analyze procedure. I just clung to the foot as a drowning man to a life preserver.",

He gave me puris (fried bread). Nobody else gives you food just for nothing.”\n\nMANY OF THE poor people in the areas around the temple or on pilgrimages came to depend upon the food that was freely given for their survival; but for the rest of us, such excessive feeding and continuous preoccupation with food seemed to indicate that the food represented something more.\n\nMy first impressions focused on all the food that was present.

    "title": "Nourishment Beyond the Plate: Embracing the Unseen Hunger of the Soul",
    "content": "Once I said, “Why do you feed so many people and why so much? I could eat four chapattis (flat unleavened bread) and stay alive.”\n\nMaharajji answered, “We have an inner thirst for food. We don’t know of it. Even if you don’t feel you can eat, your soul has a thirst for food. Take prasad!”\n\nTHE NATURE OF the food that was served around Maharajji is worthy of note, for though it satisfied our souls, our intellects were often appalled. The usual diet at the temple consisted of white rice, puris and potatoes (both fried), and sweets of almost pure white sugar. The diet was starch, grease, and sugar, and much black tea. All the sensitivity that the Western preoccupation with diet had awakened in us screamed at this diet. And yet, this was “prasad.” Did you reject prasad, or did you give up your dietary models? What did you do when the love came in the form of starch, grease, sugar, and tea? Greasy potatoes were one thing; a blessing from the guru, however, was an entirely different matter.\n\nI previously believed that a saint should observe certain restrictions as to food. Also, I never took tea or coffee, and I ate a very simple, small diet. I never took medicines. I wondered how people could take so many pills. After Maharajji left I caught a cold. At first the doctors thought it was a flu, then they said it was a more serious disease. So I had to take fifteen pills a day to cure it. It was all Maharajji’s play. The doctors also told me to put on weight so from 6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. I ate. I wondered how I could eat so much when previously I had only eaten two chapattis at a meal. All my old ideas vanished.\n\nThis was similar to what happened when I came to Kainchi, prior to which time I never drank tea. On the first day at Kainchi I did not take it, and on the second day when Maharajji asked me if I would drink tea, I didn’t reply. The third morning he asked me, “Do you want tea? You don’t want it. Here, you should drink tea. It’s a cold place!” So this time I drank tea, and since that day I take anything—tea, coffee whatever.\n\nWHEN MAHARAJJI spoke about diet he generally ignored the nutrition issues that so concerned some of us, but he did suggest that we “eat simple foods.” And he also advised us to eat food that was indigenous to the area in which we were living. And then to various devotees he gave specific instructions about diet, advising one to forego wine, meat, eggs, hot spices, “because they lead to an impure heart.” Yet to another he said, “What is this concern with what is meat and what is not. When you can live without meat, well and good. When you cannot live without it, then you should have it.” Some he counseled to “eat alone, silently, simply, or with a few people”; to others his instructions concerned the value of fasts three times a month, although when you were around him he interrupted any fast you might attempt. From this confusion of instructions, most of us came away with the feeling that he was counseling us to trust our intuitions rather than get too caught in rules. At least, that’s what we wanted to hear.\n\nBecause he fed us all so unstintingly with love and attention, as well as food, we sought ways to reciprocate. Yet his life was so simple that there was nothing to give, so most people brought flowers or food, especially fruits and sweets. These he would then distribute by his own hand or touch the food and then have it distributed. Such touching, or blessing, by such a being as Maharajji, converted the food vibrationally from a physical material into prasad. In the absence of the physical form of such a being as Maharajji, food is offered in the heart and the mind of the devotee before partaking. If food is offered purely, the beings to which it is offered accept an essence from the food. Then we eat what is left, which has become prasad. In the West, this would be similar to our saying grace before eating.\n\nMaharajji also showed a continuous concern for the quality of the food that was being distributed from the kitchens at the temple. He would call the cooks and examine the food. If it was poorly made, he would yell; if it was unnecessarily extravagant, he would yell.\n\nWhen I was living up on the hill in that little kuti (hut), Maharajji would send me away with a box of food every evening. But when he gave it to me he always checked the entire box, putting his hands all through it.",

    "title": "Letting Go of Burdens: How a Saint Feeds Our Souls",
    "content": "I purchased a dozen oranges to take to Maharajji. We arrived at the tiny temple where Maharajji was visiting and where many Indian devotees already had gathered and were crammed into his room. As soon as our presence was made known, we were pushed to the space just in front of the wooden table on which Maharajji sat. I offered the oranges to him. There was already much fruit and some sweets on the table. But then something happened that surprised me. Maharajji started to go at my oranges as if he had never seen food before. As each orange was opened he would grab it and eat it very rapidly. And before my eyes he consumed eight oranges. I was being fed the other four, at Maharajji’s insistence, by the school principal.\n\nLater I asked KK, a close Indian friend, about this peculiar behavior. KK explained that Maharajji was “taking on karma” from me and that this was a technique by which he often did that. The meaning of taking on karma is that a very high being, such as Maharajji, can work with subtle vibratory patterns and can take from devotees patterns with which they have been stuck for this lifetime or many lifetimes. For example, such a being could take away your sorrow or your ill fortune.\n\nThis process, which is a familiar one among Indian saints as well as sorcerers and medicine men from many parts of the world, can be done in a variety of ways. Often the medicine man works with a lock of hair or the feces or urine of the person suffering the effects of some negative forces, either inside or outside themselves. In India, such karmic healers often work with things the devotee gives them. Shirdi Sai Baba, a very great saint of India, would ask his devotees for annas, small coins worth less than a penny. These he would handle continuously until he had extracted the negative condition from the devotee into himself. This negative material he then could release from himself by other yogic processes. Another well-known guru in India asks his devotees for cigarettes and smokes from morning till night, year in, year out, often three or four cigarettes at a time. Maharajji’s way was to eat the karma, and he seemed to have no limit to his capacity. One woman, a long-standing devotee, told the following story:\n\nOnce in Bhumiadhar, where Maharajji was staying the night, we had all taken our evening meal and had retired at 10:30 P.M. Around 1:00 A.M. Maharajji started yelling that he was very hungry and that he must have dal (lentils) and chapattis. I awoke and reminded him that he had already eaten. But he insisted that he must have dal and chapattis. Who can understand the ways of such a being? So I woke Brahmachari Baba (the priest) and he built a fire and prepared the food. It was ready about 2:00 A.M. and we watched Maharajji consume the food with great hunger. Then we all retired again. At about 11:00, the next morning, a telegram arrived saying that one of Maharajji’s old devotees had died down on the plains (about 150 miles away) the previous night at 2:00 A.M. When the telegram was read to Maharajji he said, “You see, that’s why I needed chapattis and dal.” This aroused our curiosity, because we didn’t see at all. We pressed him but he would say nothing more. Finally after two or three days of our persistence he said, “Don’t you see? He (the man who had died) had been wishing for chapattis and dal, and I didn’t want him to carry that desire on through death for it would affect a future birth.”\n\nSometimes when visiting homes he would come to the door and say he was very hungry and ask if he could eat. In very poor homes where there might not be any food, he would just say he was very thirsty and ask for water.\n\nIn Lucknow, Maharajji took some public-works officials in a car to the poorest part of town where these officials do not take proper care of the roads and sanitation. From one of the shacks he called forth a Muslim (whom Maharajji called “a Musselman”) and they embraced, and then Maharajji said, “I’m very hungry.”\n\n“But Maharajji, I have no food.”\n\n“Ap! Wicked one! You have two rotis (flat bread) hidden in the roof!”\n\nThe man was surprised that Maharajji knew, and he got them. Even though Maharajji and the officials had just eaten, he ate one with relish and handed the other to the officials including the Hindu Brahmins, who would never eat food prepared by a Muslim, and said, “Take prasad!”",

    "content": "When Maharajji came to the Lucknow temple for the last time, he would say to each person who came (if he or she could afford to do so), “Go! Get sweets,” and when they would return with sweets, he’d distribute them, almost fifteen hundred rupees worth that day. One doctor bought a thousand rupees worth of sweets, and the personal problem causing him concern was solved.\n\nIn the period between 1939 and 1949, when Maharajji would come into a town such as Nainital, all the women would prepare food in the hope that he would come to their homes. They did it out of a mixture of loving service and the feeling that it was a blessing to feed such a saint. And KK, who followed him from early morning until late at night, once watched him consume twenty full meals in one day. Another reported watching him take ten meals in a row. And if you have been to India and understand the graciousness of the Indian home, where the guest is treated as God, you will appreciate the immense portions and the persistence in feeding. An Indian meal is more than ample for a normal human being.\n\nBut perhaps Maharajji's immense capacity represented something other than dietary requirements.\n\nOne morning Maharajji said to the people at the ashram, “You people can’t feed me or take care of me. I’m going to Ma. She’ll feed me.” And he left for the ashram of Ananda Mayee Ma, a great woman saint of northern India. During the entire trip he was saying, “She’ll feed me. I’m going to see Ma. She’ll feed me.” Then he burst into the darshan room like a child of five, with his blanket flying in all directions. She was sitting there and he was saying, “Ma! Feed me. Feed me, Ma!” She exploded in laughter. A huge meal was brought to him and the two of them passed it out to all the devotees.\n\nAgain and again Maharajji enjoined us to feed people. His concern was not merely for his own devotees but with all people who hunger. He would say, “God comes to the hungry in the form of food.” And to the cooks he would say, “Making food is a service to God. People need food to stay alive.”\n\nHe used to say that you should serve everything, every creature. “It is all God’s creation. Serve everyone, whether he be a dacoit (thief) or anything else. If he comes to you hungry, give him food.” So often he said, “Everyone has a right to be fed.”\n\nMaharajji’s own behavior set a dramatic example for us.\n\nBesides feeding all who came to have his darshan, he was continually arranging for large bhandaras (celebrations consisting of mass free feedings for all comers, including the wealthy, the poor, the beggars, the lepers). The people were fed when they arrived, for Maharajji instructed, “A starving person should not have to wait. Such a person should be fed when he is hungry.”\n\nAt these great bhandaras, which often served a thousand or more, many devotees would vie to help in the preparation and distribution of the food. Here judge and merchant, teacher and politician, could all be found peeling potatoes, stirring the huge pots, or ladling out the halva or rice with huge spoons. The Kumbha Melas were even more festive occasions. These are gatherings of hundreds of thousands of sadhus, saints, and seekers who come from all over India in order to bathe in the confluence of three rivers—the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the Saraswati, an underground spiritual river, at an auspicious astrological moment. It is like a huge spiritual fair that goes on for a month or more. At the melas Maharajji’s tent usually served 250 to 500 a day for at least a month. That is a lot of potatoes to be peeled!\n\nDuring these celebrations Maharajji demanded hard work of the devotees, and many saw these experiences as training in discipline. One devotee describes the experience this way:\n\nAt the mela, they prepared khichri (a rice and dal mixture), but the serving spoon was very heavy and soon the servers, growing tired, began to serve only small portions. As a result, the beggars would stand in line again and again to get enough to eat. Finally one of Maharajji’s devotees got very angry and just then Maharajji arrived from Chitrakut (a place sacred to devotees of Ram). He yelled at them all and said they could not serve food with anger and that they should give plenty to everyone.\n\nAnother person pointed out that the devotees were not even praised for working hard:\n\nNo matter how hard people worked at the melas and bhandaras, Maharajji would say, “You people are playing and going about doing nothing. You are always sleeping.”\n\nAlthough people were continually bringing food to Maharajji, which he distributed, sometimes there were more to receive than there were givers. It was at these times that the discerning eye caught Maharajji manifesting what is known as the “siddhi (power) of Annapurna.” Annapurna is the Goddess of Grain, the aspect of the Divine Mother that feeds the universe. One who has Annapurna’s siddhi can keep distributing from a store of food, yet it will remain full.",

He performed much service and slept at Maharajji’s feet to be always nearby. His practice was to keep fast on Tuesday, taking only milk. On one Tuesday, Maharajji offered him food but he refused, saying he’d take milk. The whole day passed and he wasn’t given any milk.\n\nLate at night Maharajji asked him if he’d eaten or drunk milk. He said no, he was fasting, but milk he’d had. Maharajji said, “You’re lying! Tell the truth! No one gave you milk.” Maharajji’s shouting woke the ashram. Maharajji questioned the cook and found that no one had remembered to give him his milk, and by now none was in the ashram. Maharajji got up and went to his room. He called the man in and told him to lock the door.\n\nMaharajji asked the time; it was after midnight. Maharajji said, “You haven’t eaten all day. It’s after midnight. Can you eat now? It’s Wednesday.” The man said he could. Maharajji reached into his dhoti and took out five parathas and two types of vegetables. Maharajji said, “It’s God’s prasad, Ram’s prasad.” The man started to leave so he could eat it outside, but Maharajji stopped him and told him to eat it there. When he was finished, Maharajji produced a small amount of khir. This the man also ate and then started out of the room to get water. Maharajji again stopped him: “Where are you going? Here’s water.” Water was kept near Maharajji’s bed for his use in the night, but the man wouldn’t use Maharajji’s vessels. Maharajji poured the water into his mouth. Then Maharajji told him not to tell anyone about the evening.\n\nOFTEN THIS PROCESS of disguise would involve incredible abuse and yelling at devotees, thus creating in them great guilt, as if it were their own sloppiness that had led to the misplacement of food. Later he would be very tender with them, and they sensed that he had used them but not abused them.\n\nOne time they ran out of ghee at Hanuman Ghar, and Maharajji asked a devotee, in secret, to get some water in a bucket and put it in the woods. Then he said, in his usual direct manner, “I have to go piss,” and he went out. When he returned, he was yelling. He went over to a sadhu and berated him for not watching the supply. He said thieves were going to steal the ghee. “Look,” Maharajji said, “they have put a tin of ghee out here in the woods.” And they brought in the bucket filled with ghee.",

    "content": "I was in Allahabad with Maharajji at mela time. Maharajji said there were some Ma’s who had come from Nainital and added, “Let’s go to the mela grounds and find them.” We took a taxi, which Maharajji dismissed once we arrived. It was dark and many thousands of people were crowded there. Maharajji sent me and a friend to look, but we were fearful of losing him, so we made only a cursory inspection and rushed back, saying that we could not find the Ma’s. Finally Maharajji said he would go. In the third tent that he investigated, he found them just as they were finishing a puja to Maharajji. They had been doing this puja every day for thirty days, hoping for his darshan. This was the final day. They had even made an image of Maharajji.\n\nMaharajji walked in and stood at the back of the tent, then he brought the Ma’s to another devotee’s house and sent us out for milk and sweets. We were students and did not want to spend all our money, so we said to each other, “After all, how much can a Ma drink?” We brought small amounts of sweets and milk, for which Majarajji berated us and threw us out. We sat on the porch, repentant. Later he called us into his room and asked, “Do you think I needed you to get sweets?” And there in the room were buckets and buckets of sweets, and Maharajji made us eat and eat.\n\nThe retired superintendent of prisons of Lucknow, a very old and respected devotee, tells of his experience with Maharajji. The story is very special in that it reflects the faith of his wife, which was sufficient to allow Maharajji’s siddhi of Annapurna work through her.\n\nHe would put you in the wrong, catch you unprepared, then help you. One night in Nainital we had returned to our house for the evening meal, after having been with Maharajji much during the day. There were four of us, and my wife had prepared just enough food for our family. Then my small daughter heard Maharajji passing by on his way from the government house and she went out and said, “Maharajji, we live here. Come to our house.”\n\nI called her and said, “Don’t bother Maharajji. We have been with him much today.” Also I realized that we had only a little food. But Maharajji said, “No, I must go to your house,” and he came in, bringing about twenty people. After a very few minutes he said to me, “These people are hungry. Give them food.” I wouldn’t say no because I knew his strength, so I went toward the kitchen. Maharajji yelled, “And hurry up!” In the kitchen I whispered to my wife the dilemma we were in. We had only enough vegetables in the small pot for the four of us, and the market was far below and already closed.\n\nMy wife, who had more faith than I, said, “Don’t worry. Maharajji will take care of it. Here, take this small pot (which she had covered) and don’t remove the cover to look inside. And there is a large serving spoon. Just serve the people and I will make the puris.” I did as she said, not looking inside. I knew it was going to be very odd.\n\nTo each person I gave one or two large spoonfuls, then asked each, “Do you want more?” Some said yes and I gave it to them. Everyone got as much vegetable and puri as they wanted. Maharajji was smiling. Then he said, “Everyone has taken. Everyone is full. This is a very big feast.”\n\nA number of stories of the “early days” have filtered down about Maharajji. How much is fact and how much is fiction is uncertain. Here is a delightful example:\n\nThe village children of the area often came to the lake, herding their cows and goats. One day, seeing no one around, they hung their lunch bundles in the low-hanging branches of the trees and went off to play. They returned to find their lunches missing and Maharajji sitting contentedly under the tree. He smiled at the children, and in exchange for their food he pulled puris and laddus (a sweet particularly favored by Hanuman) from under his garment. The children ate to their hearts’ content.",

I was afraid, you see, that someone’s carelessness might cause him inconvenience or pain; like your mother would feel if you came home from school and she was not there—she’d worry about who would feed and take care of you. It was like that.\n\nAMONG THE Westerners there was also considerable variety in the ways of seeing Maharajji and being with him. Although many of us had extremely intimate relations with Maharajji, nevertheless, the more formal term “guru,” with its emphasis as a vehicle for spiritual liberation, would seem a more appropriate label than “baba.” Because gurus were not commonplace in the culture from which we had come, we tended to invest more heavily in the guru mythos. We didn’t particularly want a grandfather or another friend. We wanted God or at least a divine intermediary. And that’s how most of us saw Maharajji. In these quotations some differences among us become apparent:\n\n(One Western devotee speaks to another.) I didn’t need to be around him a lot. It was okay for everyone else who had to be around him constantly. I think that my traveling with you was good because you were a perfect complement to me. You had to be near Maharajji, you had to sit at his feet; you had to pick up every little detail, hear every little story.

    "title": "Finding Your Path to the Divine Through Selfless Service",
    "content": "Because of the longing for him and the sense of being in the presence of my own divine holy God-Mother, I always felt Maharajji to be as my Mother; Maharajji was like the Ma for me. Maharajji’s relation to God was totally internal and subtle.\n\nIt was just so fine to be who you are, to be yourself. The playfulness was so infinite, the heart-opening so wide.\n\nIn the following comparison between the behaviors of two of the devotees, another dimension of difference becomes clear.\n\nWhen Devotee A was in the temple, it was predictable that if any Westerner were allowed near Maharajji, he would be the one. There was no limit to the ingenuity he employed to remain in Maharajji’s presence for every possible second. If Maharajji told people to go away, A would be the last to leave and then might go immediately around the back of the building, pick a flower off a tree, and arrive from the other side, as if he were just arriving for the first time. When others were being told to go, he would often hide so as to avoid being included in the expulsion edict. It developed into an elaborate game, in which Maharajji was a participant.\n\nA was a master of his game. He seemed to have a special sense that told him where Maharajji would be any moment, and he managed to be there, waiting. Others tried to compete in this game but none approached A’s totally one-pointed (or, depending upon how you saw it, totally selfish) behavior. Others were hampered by guilt or compassion for others—feelings which, if mentioned, elicited only an uncomprehending look from A.\n\nDevotee B was an entirely different story. If Maharajji sent us to help in the kitchen, B would remain peeling potatoes long after others had given up and drifted back to Maharajji. He would stay until the last potato was peeled and then look for more work. Although he had been trained as an attorney in the United States, his service and humility at the temple were so outstanding that soon he was in charge of kitchens and storerooms. He remained in the temple performing the purest service for five years, until he was evicted by the government. No job was too menial and there was no evidence of personal pride about his humility, nor any effort to get attention for his work. It was truly as if he came closest to God through his service. He hardly ever came near Maharajji, and when he did it was usually only to touch his feet and then go back to his duties.\n\nDevotees like A often infuriated other devotees because they seemed to be monopolizing Maharajji, while devotees like B aroused respect and sometimes guilt in others. Yet intuitively we knew that each in his own way was a pure devotee, and Maharajji obviously loved them both.\n\nAs varied as were all the ways of seeing and being with Maharajji, so were his reactions. He responded to each according to his or her capacity to absorb. In the infinitely changing nature of Maharajji’s behavior, each person found what he or she needed. Because he stood nowhere he was like a mirror, showing each devotee the baba or guru that they projected. Often with one act he fed simultaneously the disparate needs of a dozen devotees.\n\nWho can say with these saints? They are like the sky. Maharajji’s mind was completely clear. He would seem to have no thoughts; only that which Bhagavan (God) willed would come into his mind. Like a cloud it would come and then—whup—oh, such action that thought would produce! And again, like a cloud it would pass.",

He said, “You don’t understand me. If I tell a man he is a great bhakta (devotee), I am planting a seed.

    "content": "In those days Maharajji never stayed too long in one place—seldom more than two or three days—so I wasn’t able to get his darshan more than a few times. Then I left Kanpur for Calcutta for twenty years, where I was very busy and had no connection with Maharajji. When I returned to Kanpur I remembered Maharajji, wondering where he was and growing annoyed at myself for not seeking him. I left my meals for two months. My wife asked me why I was angry, why I wouldn’t eat grains, but I never told her the reason. I was deeply annoyed with myself.\n\nOnce in Allahabad a man asked that I have the darshan of a very good saint. Without knowing the saint’s name, I was taken to Dada’s house. Maharajji saw me and said, “Why have you not eaten your meals for two months?”\n\nI replied, “Why have you not given me darshan? I may be mad, but you are a saint—you shouldn’t be mad.” Like a child I spoke very rudely to him.\n\nSomeone asked me, “Are you going to have a fight with Maharajji?”\n\nI said, “Yes, of course. Why shouldn’t I fight? He is like my father and I his son. Why shouldn’t we fight? Don’t interfere.”\n\nMaharajji said, “Please don’t interfere. He is my very old devotee.”\n\nThe people went away and Maharajji turned to me and said, “Now go home. I will come to your house tomorrow morning and I’ll take my meal there.”\n\nI said, “All right, when you take your meal at my place, only then will I start taking grains. If you don’t come, I will not.”\n\nMaharajji said, “Come tomorrow.”\n\nI said, “No, Maharajji. I have no reliance on your words. You tell me to come for you tomorrow, but you may not be here then. Then what will my position be? I won’t go. I’ll sleep tonight here on the verandah or on the grass.”\n\nMaharajji said, “No. There’s no place for you to sleep here.”\n\nI said, “It doesn’t matter, Maharajji. I’ll sleep outside the gate on the public road with one or two bricks for a pillow. Then in the morning I’ll catch hold of you.”\n\nMaharajji said, “Oh, no. You must rely on me. I will definitely go with you. You go!”\n\nMaharajji insisted, giving me his firm word. He then sent someone after me to drive me home. This man asked me to wait for half an hour. I sat down. Several people who had overheard my discussion with Maharajji told me that Maharajji often gives a blank check that is never cashed. He may or may not come.\n\nI told them that I would come the following morning, and if Maharajji didn’t come with me, I would take the oath that I would not even drink water until he came.\n\nAs I was saying this Maharajji immediately came from inside: “Wait, wait. I’ll go with you just now.”\n\nWe climbed into two cars and drove to my house, arriving at about eleven at night. No fresh food was available, but Maharajji ate of the leftovers from dinner, taking a little of whatever was offered. He said, “I’ve taken. Now you eat. Start eating grains and don’t fast.” Then he left. This is the story of Maharajji’s blessing upon me. By and by it increased.\n\nOFTEN THE quality of the play between Maharajji and devotees was truly childlike.\n\nMaharajji would plead with me like a spoiled child. “Oh, Ma, please sing bhajan (devotional song).” He would quote the song, “A well without water, a cow without milk, a temple without a lamp, so is a man without bhajan.”",

I was very uncertain about the whole matter, so I wrote to KK in India and asked him to find out from Maharajji whether I should go to Chile for these studies. Then the answer came back from KK: “Maharajji says that you can go and study with a Sufi saint if you desire.”\n\nAs I read the letter something happened in my heart and I suddenly felt absolutely certain that I didn’t want to go, and so I didn’t. On my next visit to India, when discussing this letter with KK, he told me, “When I asked Maharajji, he said, ‘If he wishes, let him go …’ And then he said, ‘Why would he want to go?’ But then quickly he added, ‘Don’t write that last part in the letter.’” \n\nIT WAS AT THIS deeper level that we felt Maharajji to be the shepherd and ourselves to be a part of the flock. Through this unspoken process we developed faith where previously there had been fear. Our faith was that in the midst of the changing uncertainties of the universe, if we kept Maharajji in our hearts, if we just stayed under his blanket in trust, then it would be all right.\n\nDevotees who had been with Maharajji for many years often reflected a fearlessness in the manner in which they lived, as the result of their faith in his protection. Some he specifically taught to be fearless.\n\nMaharajji once called me over and said, “Ram Dass, you are to fear nothing.”",

The doctor tested my eyes and found that the new specs the Bombay doctor had given were the wrong prescription. That was corrected.

They had only two cots. Maharajji said, “I’ll sleep now.” They gave him one of the cots and a blanket. The old couple stayed up the whole night watching Maharajji. He was groaning and moving in the bed until 4:00 A.M. At 4:30, Maharajji became quiet; then he took the bed sheet and wrapped something in it. He told the old man, “It’s very heavy. Don’t try to see what’s in it. You should throw it into the Ganga where it is deep. No one should see you or you’ll be arrested.” As he was taking it to the Ganga, he felt it and it was full of bullets. When he returned, the old man was told by Maharajji, “Don’t worry. Your son is coming in a month.” When the son came some weeks later, he said he had almost died. His company had been ambushed by the enemy and by chance, he had fallen into a ditch. All night, bullets were flying left and right. At 4:00 A.M., the Japanese saw that they had killed everyone, and so they retreated. At 4:30, the Indian troops came. The son was the only survivor.

He went straight to a devotee’s house and told the people there to go to the old pilgrimage rest cabin at the Shiva temple and bring back whomever was staying there. For years no one had stayed in the dilapidated rest cabin, so the devotees thought it very unusual when they found the doors locked from within. They knocked and shouted but no one answered. Then they returned and reported to Maharajji.\n\nMaharajji left that house and went to see another devotee, where he again sent people to the rest house with instructions not to return without its occupant. They caused a great commotion at the door until finally an old man opened the window. He tried to send the devotees away but they persisted, until finally the man and his wife were taken to Maharajji. Immediately Maharajji started shouting, “Do you think you can threaten God by starving yourselves? He won’t let his devotees die so easily. Take prasad!” He called for puris and sweets, but the man refused them. Maharajji insisted, and finally they both ate.\n\nThe couple had come from south India on a pilgrimage to Badrinath and other holy places. They were from a very rich family but had decided to leave home and family behind to devote their remaining years to prayer. They had resolved to pay their own way and never to beg. As they were returning from Badrinath, all their money and possessions had been stolen. They had only enough money for bus fare to Bhimtal, where they found the deserted rest cabin. They resolved to stay there and die, since that seemed to be the Lord’s will. They had been locked inside without food for three days before Maharajji forced them out. Maharajji insisted that they accept money for their trip back to Madras. They said that they would not beg. Maharajji said they were not begging and they could mail the money back when they reached home. They accepted the money and were sent off.",

Maharajji and I were picking our way through the crowd, and one woman came and bowed before him and requested that he come and bless a newborn baby some distance from where we were. Maharajji agreed.\n\nFurther along, the same woman was complaining bitterly of the destruction of Lahore. Maharajji immediately chastised her with a rhetorical question: “Didn’t that saint in Lahore tell you six months ago that this was going to happen?”\n\nSometimes when many people came to him he would relate each person’s personal history, including what their forefathers had done, as if he had been well acquainted with that person for a very long time.",

I was too well-bred to say anything; inside though, I was angry and remained silent for the remainder of the drive to the temple. As we entered the temple Maharajji said, “Ram Dass is angry.” But I had hidden it well and everyone disagreed with Maharajji and said that, on the contrary, I had been very pleasant. But Maharajji was not to be deterred.\n\n“No,” he said, “Ram Dass is angry because the young women wouldn’t get out and help push.” (R.D.)",

It gives rise to a type of intimacy that is unparalleled in most of our human relationships. Those of us who are close to another person often sense what the other is feeling. When we have come to know the way another thinks, we may even be able to guess what is on his or her mind. But there are so many tiny, subtle thoughts; and many of these are censored almost the moment they come to mind because they would be socially unacceptable or even unacceptable to our own conscious image of ourselves. To realize that someone has access even to these thoughts immediately puts you at an extraordinary disadvantage, as if your opponent had broken your code. You are so vulnerable. But of course it is also incredibly exciting to meet another consciousness in such an intimate way. And with Maharajji, added to this was a quality of unconditional love coming from the other, as if he were saying to you, “I know all about you and I love you.”\n\nThe most precious things about Maharajji cannot be described in stories—like massaging his legs. If I had a useless thought as I was massaging him, he’d pull my hand away; and then, when I would recenter my mind, he’d put my hand back. In those subtle ways he would teach you.",

I went through the streets of Calcutta and I saw all the beggars, thought about their suffering, and as usual got into my argument with God about suffering. “It’s really not necessary,” I kept telling him.\n\nAt that time I was reading the Phaedo, Plato’s account of Socrates’ death, which ends with Socrates and his disciples discussing whether Socrates should postpone taking the hemlock, and Socrates says to bring it in, because it doesn’t make any difference. The disciples are all crying and he tells them, “Listen, there are only two possibilities: either there is something after death or there is nothing after death. If there is nothing after death, then thank God at last I’m going to get a good sleep. And if there is something after death, then at least I have the chance of having a good conversation.” Then they brought the hemlock, which he took and died.\n\nSo I reasoned that if Socrates, in all his wisdom, at the time of his death didn’t know the nature of life, then I really shouldn’t feel so despondent that a simple soul like me didn’t understand. Thus I was consoled.\n\nWife: At the same time my husband was in Calcutta, I was in Delhi looking for Maharajji. We finally found him at the home of the Barmans in New Delhi (this was his last visit to New Delhi before he left his body). We were sitting with him in the afternoon on the same day he had arrived. Maharajji looked at me and simply said, “Socrates.” Later on that same day he looked at me again and said, “Socrates.”\n\nI discussed this with the devotees accompanying me, trying to figure out what he had meant. Perhaps it was that I looked or thought like Socrates, but we couldn’t quite figure it out. My husband came home from Calcutta, and after telling him that I had seen Maharajji I said, “You know, he said the strangest thing to me and we still don’t understand what it means. He looked at me and called me ‘Socrates.’ What do you think it means?” Then my husband told me what he’d been thinking and we figured out that it was exactly the same day my husband just described.",

    "content": "A number of us Westerners were meditating together at a Buddhist ashram in Bodh Gaya. After a time, some of us were ready to take a break and go on to Delhi, several hundred miles away, to celebrate Shiva’s birthday. One of the women in the group, who had come to India overland by charter bus, reported that the bus driver wanted to hang out with us, too. So thirty-four of us left Bodh Gaya and met the bus in Benares and started to drive to Delhi.\n\nOne of the men in the group, Danny, had left the courses briefly in the middle to visit Allahabad, in order to experience a Kumbha Mela. He had returned deeply impressed and bringing us each small medallions depicting the monkey, Hanuman, which he had purchased on the mela grounds.\n\nWhen it turned out that the bus route went right by Allahabad, Danny pressed us to visit the mela grounds. I protested that the mela was now over and it would just be an empty piece of riverbank. But he pointed out that it was one of the most sacred spots in India. Some of us were tired, for it was only our first day out in the world after such sustained meditation practice, and all we really wanted was to get to the dharmasalla where we planned to stay overnight. The thought of even driving the few miles out of our way to get to the river was not appealing, and yet it was a very holy place. I weighed the merits of the alternatives and finally agreed that we should go to the river for a brief stop to watch the sunset.\n\nAs we approached and drove down into the mela grounds, which were now quite deserted, the driver asked where he should park. Danny pointed to a place that he said was near a Hanuman temple and also was the spot where he had purchased the small medallions.\n\nAs the bus was pulling up to that spot, someone yelled, “There’s Maharajji!”\n\nSure enough, walking right by the bus with Dada, there he was. We all scrambled off the bus and rushed to his feet. I was having an hysterical crying-laughing fit. I remember kissing his feet in bliss and at the same moment my mind being aware that the spot of sand on which he was standing smelled strongly of urine.\n\nDada later told us that as the bus came into view, Maharajji had said, “Well, they’ve come.”\n\nMaharajji instructed us to follow them, and the bus followed the bicycle rickshaw to Dada’s house on the suburban street of this great university city. Within minutes we were given food, and arrangements were made for us to lodge at a nearby estate with another devotee. I was told that since morning the servants had been preparing food under Maharajji’s orders in anticipation of our coming. But if that were so, which of us thought he was making a decision in the bus about whether to visit the mela grounds? Apparently all was not as I “thought” it was. (R.D.)\n\nONLY MAHARJJI knew why he remembered whom he did when he did. Apparently, however, it was not all in his hands, for many devotees found that by thinking about him, they drew his attention, or even his physical presence.\n\nSaid one Ma, “If the devotion is strong enough, the guru is drawn by the devotee.”",

At one point, his doctor gave him only twenty-four hours to live, but the man remembered Maharajji, meditated on him, and refused to die. On the third day, Maharajji arrived in the city and went to the home of another devotee. He said to him, “There’s an old man living near here. He’s thinking of me very much and he’s very sick. We must visit him.”\n\nUpon entering the sick man’s room, they found him in very grave condition. Maharajji placed his foot near the man’s head. The dying man pranammed to Maharajji and then left his body.\n\nMaharajji said to the other devotee, “He was remembering me very much. Darshan was given, then finished! The end!”\n\nI AM HERE AND I AM IN AMERICA.\n\nWHOEVER REMEMBERS ME, I GO TO.\n\nCHAOS AND CONFUSION\n\nWHEREVER MAHARAJII was, there was chaos and confusion. Some times two people were sent to do the same task, other times one was sent to undo what the first was in the process of doing. Maharajji would tell one person one thing and another something opposite; when confronted with such inconsistencies he would deny all. Such confusion served a number of obvious purposes. First, it veiled his powers so that no one could be quite certain what had just happened. And the confusion also allowed each person to hear what he or she needed to hear from among the conflicting bits of information. Such inconsistencies served to loosen the minds of those devotees with problems of rigid thinking. From another point of view one could understand the confusion as a reflection of the fact that Maharajji was not just one person. As a mirror, he was the reflection of whomever was thinking upon him, and he was conscious on many planes at once. Thus, one statement, such as “I can do nothing,” might be followed moments later by the statement, “I hold the keys to the mind. Everyone is my puppet.” Appreciating this dimension of Maharajji made one delight in the confusion.\n\nTwo longtime devotees were told that they would be able to find Maharajji at a certain temple on the banks of the Ganga. They went there immediately and found him. He acted as if he’d never seen them before. “Who are you? Where do you come from? What work do you do? Why have you come here?” He inquired of each of them. They patiently answered him until finally he said, “Sit down!”",

Maharajji insisted that these remedies wouldn’t work, and what was needed was a certain medicine he’d once seen in Dada’s home. He called it the “moustache-man medicine,” and twirled his moustache to indicate it. He said it was the only medicine that would work.\n\nAll this meant nothing to Dada, who couldn’t recall any moustache-related medicine in his home. Later in the day Dada went to the bazaar to buy supplies for the ashram. While in the pharmacy he noticed a picture of a moustachioed man on a small box containing Sloan’s Balm, a heat-producing medicine. He purchased it and gave it to Maharajji. Maharajji shouted, “That’s it! The moustache medicine! Put it on!” Moments after the balm was rubbed onto his knee, Maharajji announced that the pain had vanished and that now he was fine.",

He demonstrated that when we let go of our need to control outcomes, we open ourselves to the miraculous possibilities that life has to offer.

    "title": "When the weight of hunger leads to unexpected miracles",
    "content": "IN THE TRADITION of the great yogis of India, Maharajji’s powers extended far beyond the realm of knowing the minds of others. A profusion of miracles poured out of him, and though he threw dust in our eyes with denials and confusion, we were still allowed to sense this extraordinary process. But as astonishing and dramatic as such phenomena were, they were not, in the eyes of the close devotees of Maharajji, the essence of the matter. Maharajji himself was the miracle. Just being around him made the commonplace seem miraculous, and, conversely, the miraculous came to seem quite ordinary. Yet when devotees gather, it is still the miracle stories that come most readily to their lips. Perhaps this is because such stories are “tellable,” while the ocean of love, the tenderness, and the healing compassion with which Maharajji—like Christ—worked his true wonders upon us, these are ineffable.\n\nWhat were these miraculous powers about? Perhaps they served the function that the great saint Shirdi Sai Baba, who used miracles in an outrageous fashion, attributed to them: “I give them what they want, so they will want what I give.” All the miracles concern the physical universe, the world, the material plane, but the essence of the business that we have with such beings as Maharajji is of the spirit, which is far beyond such miracles. Miracles are only the unexpected; and in the spirit there is no expected, so there is no unexpected.\n\nThis is how Maharajji became known as Neem Karoli Baba, which means the sadhu from Neem Karoli (or Neeb Karori). This was many years ago, perhaps when Maharajji was in his late twenties or early thirties.\n\nFor several days, no one had given him any food and hunger drove him to board a train for the nearest city. When the conductor discovered Maharajji seated in the first-class coach without a ticket, he pulled the emergency brake and the train ground to a halt. After some verbal debate, Maharajji was unceremoniously put off the train. The train had stopped near the village of Neeb Karori where Maharajji had been living.\n\nMaharajji sat down under the shade of a tree while the conductor blew his whistle and the engineer opened the throttle. But the train didn’t move. For some time the train sat there while every attempt was made to get it to move. Another engine was called in to push it, but all to no avail. A local magistrate with one arm who knew of Maharajji suggested to the officials that they coax that young sadhu back onto the train. Initially the officials were appalled by such superstition, but after many frustrating attempts to move the train they decided to give it a try.\n\nMany passengers and railway officials approached Maharajji, carrying with them food and sweets as offerings to him. They requested that he board the train. He agreed on two conditions: (I) the railway officials must promise to have a station built for the village of Neeb Karori (at the time the villagers had to walk many miles to the nearest station), and (2) the railroad must henceforth treat sadhus better. The officials promised to do whatever was in their power, and Maharajji finally reboarded the train.\n\nThen they asked Maharajji to start the train. He got very abusive and said, “What, is it up to me to start trains?” The engineer started the train, the train traveled a few yards, and then the engineer stopped it and said, “Unless the sadhu orders me, I will not go forward.” Maharajji said, “Let him go.” And they proceeded.\n\nMaharajji said that the officials kept their word, and soon afterward a train station was built at Neeb Karori and sadhus received more respect.",

Many devotees were gathered along that route, all of them hoping for one glimpse of darshan as he was leaving. These last darshans delayed Maharajji, and Siddhi Ma and the Mothers with whom he was to travel were all on the train.\n\nIt was my pleasure in those days to attend to such matters as reservations, so I was busy seating the Ma’s and seeing to their needs. Maharajji was still outside of the station with the devotees when the engineer and the conductor signaled for the train to start. I thought, “Oh, my God. What will happen? I myself will stay on the train with the Mothers. I can’t let them go on alone.” But for a full four minutes the engineer struggled with the train but couldn’t make it budge.

I was sure that I was wasting our time and we’d have to cash them in.\n\nMaharajji walked into the station, walked slowly along the platform, and stopped, stolid, at one spot. When the train pulled in, a first-class, air-conditioned car was stopped directly in front of Maharajji. I had watched how he chose that very spot to stand in, so I asked the conductor, who happened to be standing right there, for two berths in that car, and he said, “What! Are you crazy? This train is full from Calcutta to Kalka!”\n\nAt that moment I lost my assurance and looked over to Maharajji. He merely raised one finger and said quietly, “Attendant.”\n\nSo I went over to the car attendant and asked again for two berths, and he said, “Yes, yes, there is room for you. You see, a party who was reserved clear through had to get off at Mogul Serai to attend to unexpected business. There are two berths vacant in this car.” It was the car directly in front of Maharajji.",

I asked Maharajji what to do and he said to stop a truck and have the truck tow the car. All the trucks, however, were going in the opposite direction. I reported this to Maharajji, who replied, “Oh, these Brahmins are so stingy, they won’t put up enough money to hire a truck to pull the car.” (I had a thousand rupees to put up, which was enough.) Finally I got a bus that would pull the car. I bought a rope and we were just leaving when a bus came from the other direction warning that there was a bus check-stop ahead, so that the bus shouldn’t try towing the car. It was dark by now, and there were no hotels, so I went to Maharajji and said, “Here are the choices: We can sit in the car all night long like this with no blankets; we can get a truck to tow us back; or we can go on,” (this last choice implying that we would have to depend on Maharajji’s powers, since the clutch was now gone).\n\nMaharajji said, “Let’s go on.”\n\nAll the way to Srinagar there was no occasion to stop or use the clutch, and we never even needed gas.

It was some three years after Maharajji left his body that the man first told this story.\n\nYOU SHOULD NOT TALK ABOUT YOUR WEALTH, WIFE, OR SADHANA OR THEY WILL GO AWAY.\n\nMAHARAJJI’S STRATEGY obviously worked, for he was known to those he chose to be known to, yet unknown to the population at large.

Perhaps that was the greatest sign of his power.\n\nWhen the Westerners started to come to Maharajji, he changed. He began to allow photographs to be taken and even gave his blessings for a book, Be Here Now, which allowed millions of seekers in the Western world to hear of Maharajji and his powers.

Perhaps he felt similar to Shirdi Sai Baba, who said, “I don’t give them powers because I don’t want them to lose their way.” Rather than any siddhis or yogic powers, Maharajji gave us more basic things: faith, loving hearts, and an acceptance of the reality of the Divine. At the same time, he recognized that some of the devotees had desire for such powers, and he enjoyed playing with those people.\n\nIn 1967 Maharajji asked me, “You want to fly?” I had a pilot’s license at the time, and though I knew that this wasn’t what he meant, I said somewhat facetiously, “I already can fly, Maharajji.”\n\nMaharajji ignored my response and said, “You want to fly. You’ll fly.”\n\nIt was not until 1972, over four years later, while working with a mantra under the direction of a swami, that I experienced astral flying.

Only recently have I come to see Gandhi in terms of compassion rather than power. Maharajji’s statement made me do much work on myself.\n\nTo add a bit more fuel to the fire of these attachments of mine, one day Maharajji asked, “Did you have tea at Nixon’s house?” I was puzzled, for the question was without a context. But then I remembered that the Englishman who had settled in Almora many years before, who was known as Krishna Prem and was considered by many Indians to be a saint, had originally been named Nixon. I asked Maharajji if it was this Nixon to whom he referred.\n\n“No, the one with the big white house in America. The one with the house bigger than Muktananda’s.”\n\nThere was no mistaking it now; he meant the president. “No, I never did.”\n\nThen thinking maybe there was a confusion of generations, I added, helpfully, “But my father has.”\n\n“Weren’t you in Mr. Nixon’s house and he gave you tea and was very nice to you?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Oh.” Nothing more. Just another little suggestion that perhaps I was to play in the halls of worldly power.\n\nAnd another day he spoke again about the presidency. This time he said,\n\n“You know, Lincoln was a very good president.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Yes. He was a good president because he knew Christ was the real president. He was only acting president.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“Yes, he was very good. He helped the poor and suffering. He never forgot Christ.”\n\n“Ah!”\n\nThen he asked, “Did you know Lincoln?” There was an embarrassed silence, for everyone present knew of that “impossibility.” Then Dada told Maharajji that I couldn’t have, since Lincoln died in 1865.

    "content": "The head of the state police of Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in India, had come for darshan and was sitting at Maharajji’s feet and rubbing his legs with obvious devotion. I was called to join them, and Maharajji introduced him to me and asked me whether the police in America were like the police in India. As I looked at this superintendent of state police rubbing Maharajji’s legs I could only laugh at the comparison. I said that the police in America had great power and often forgot they were the servants of the people. And I added that it would be unlikely for the head of any state police to kneel and rub the feet of a holy man. Maharajji then introduced me to the policeman, saying, “This is Ram Dass. He is going to bring the police of America to God.” I had to laugh. Now he was implying future powers even greater than my fantasies.\n\nIt was also around this time that Maharajji started calling me Samarth Guru Ram Dass. In the past he had called me by one name or another (e.g., “Isha”—Jesus—or “Kabir”), each for a few weeks. Each time a new name appeared, albeit briefly, I would make inquiries as to the nature of the person who had become my namesake and would try it on for size. Jesus I already knew about. Kabir was a great saint, a very poor weaver who preached the unity of all religions and was legendary for his outspoken beliefs in God. His poetry was already much revered in my heart. At first it seemed that Samarth Guru Ram Das must refer to the Sikh Guru Ram Das, but then I found a book that described a Samarth Guru Ram Das, who was guru to King Sivajji in the 1600s and had constructed many Hanuman temples. The name Samarth meant “all-powerful” and there are many stories of his miraculous powers. He lived in a mud hut next to the king’s palace. The king was highly regarded for his concern for his subjects and for his generous feeding of the poor, but apparently now and then his ego got the best of him. When this happened the guru would do things like splitting a rock in which there were many tiny bugs and asking the king, “Who was feeding these bugs?” This realization of the triviality of his own efforts would again humble the king.\n\nI liked this name, and while I wanted all the powers Maharajji seemed to be alluding to, I knew that if he gave me those powers I would indeed get lost in them. Now and then, however, Maharajji would set me up for an experience that, by allowing me to help him, showed me that the true powers poured forth when one realized, “I can do nothing; God does everything.”\n\nOn one occasion Maharajji said to me, “Hari Dass is in America. You keep him there for five years.”\n\nI knew that Hari Dass had only a three-month visa and that to get a permanent visa—that is, to become a registered alien in the United States—is no easy matter. So I said to Maharajji, “I can’t do that. I have no political power in the United States.”\n\nBut Maharajji would not hear my reply. He just repeated, “You keep Hari Dass in America for five years. I kept Bhagavan Das here for seven years.” The implications of this made me laugh. Here was Maharajji, who had all kinds of powers, making this absurd comparison. My power within the United States government was absolutely zero, so again I protested. But he was equally adamant, so I said that I would certainly work on it.\n\nA few days prior to that conversation, a Westerner from Los Angeles, whom I had never met before, came to Nainital to see me. I explained to him that my guru was nearby and took him to see Maharajji, who gave him the name Badrinath Das. The fellow was very taken with Maharajji and genuinely appreciative that I had arranged the meeting. On his last day in Nainital, which was the day after the Hari Dass conversation with Maharajji, Badrinath Das thanked me again and asked me if there was anything he could do for me in the States. I asked him, “For instance, what?” and he told me that he was a successful lawyer in Los Angeles. At the moment I could not think of any friends who were in trouble, but I thanked him for the offer. Then as an afterthought I said, “I have a family full of lawyers, but the only legal thing I need now is to get Hari Dass Baba a long-term visa in America,” and I explained to him Maharajji’s orders.\n\nBadrinath Das said, “Gee, it’s funny you should need that. My brother-in-law happens to be the director of the Western United States Office of Immigration, and we should be able to arrange it with one letter.” And so it was done. When Hari Dass came to the immigration department for an interview, his folder had special VIP stickers on it, and his alien visa was granted with no difficulty.\n\nObviously Maharajji had known how it all would happen, but instead of bringing it out with Badrinath Das himself, he let me help him.\n\nBut while with one hand Maharajji played with my desires for worldly power, with the other he subtly uprooted them. One day while I was sitting with Maharajji and KK, many CID men came to have Maharajji’s darshan. They were in attendance upon Indira Gandhi, who was visiting nearby. After they left Maharajji said, “What good is all that? A king can only order his men to obey, but a saint can order wild beasts and animals to obey and they would do so also.”\n\nBetween this belittlement of a worldly king, the Samarth Guru Ram Das stories, and Lincoln’s appreciation of who the real president was, Maharajji impressed upon me the very real limits of the worldly power that most humans seek. These teachings have continued to work upon me since that time.",

The minister told Nehru he had faith that Maharajji knew everything and if Maharajji wanted to give darshan he would come.

In any case, Maharajji’s whereabouts were unknown to the devotee.\n\nThat same evening, Maharajji telephoned and said to the devotee, Nehru’s minister, “Tell him not to worry.

A boy who attended the lecture that night got on the first plane the next morning, few from Cleveland, Ohio, to New York, to London, to New Delhi, where he got in a taxi and rode up to Kainchi. Less than thirty-six hours earlier he had heard Ram Dass talking about Maharajji. He walked into the ashram. He had taken off his shirt, since it was so hot, and I could see that on his chest he had a bad rash. I welcomed him and asked him where he had come from, and he told me his story. Then I asked him why he hadn’t treated his rash. He explained that all the medical authorities had told him it was incurable; he’d tried injections and salves, and nothing had worked.\n\nI said that was silly—it was just tinia corpus, which is really very easy to cure. I said that, in fact, Dwarka was going to Nainital and he could get the sulphur tar to cure it and could bring it back that night. Then in a few days the rash would be gone. And he said to me, “I heard Ram Dass just two days ago. And now I’ve met Doctor America (Maharajji’s nickname for me) and I’m here in Maharajji’s ashram. Anything you say!” His eyes were as big as saucers.\n\nDwarka brought back the sulphur tar. I showed the boy how to use it and told him the rash would be cured in just a few days. He agreed to use it and said he was on his way to Badrinath that day for a week. And he went off to the chai stall.\n\nI got to thinking that it had been a long time since I’d practiced medicine and I was a bit rusty. I went to where I was staying and checked my medical books about this disease that I had just diagnosed. I realized that I had diagnosed the wrong disease. The treatment I had given him was absolutely useless, so I raced down to the chai stall, just in time to see him get on the bus and be gone. I felt very bad. By misdiagnosing his disease, not only had I failed as Maharajji’s representative, but I’d sent the boy off with a useless medicine—and when he came back, he was going to think that all the people around Maharajji were fools and incompetents. The week that he was gone was just awful for me. I had done something terrible.\n\nAfter a week passed he came back. I saw him from across the ashram and ran out to him and said, “I’m sorry!”\n\nHe said, “Sorry? Look!” He opened his shirt and his chest was completely healed. Not even a scar. It was all gone. I didn’t understand, but I knew it wasn’t the medicine that I had given him.\n\nI went to the window of Maharajji’s room we called the “office,” and I said, “Maharajji, thank you. You cured him.”\n\nHe said, “Sub Ishwar hai (It’s all God).”",

You think and he talks.\n\nI was thinking, “Why should I do anything—it is all in his hands.”\n\nHe replied out loud, “No! There is a doctor. Goto Agra. He is a heart specialist. He is a great disciple.” Then Maharajji turned to one of the Ma’s standing by and said, “Tell him how I sent your relative to him. This doctor is a great saint.”\n\nShe said, “When I showed the doctor the letter that Maharajji had sent us, he came running to treat my relative at the house.”\n\nMaharajji said, “And what happened?”\n\n“Well, in only two or three days she was all right.”\n\n“Just see! Just see!” Maharajji exclaimed to me. “He is my great disciple. You go! Tomorrow, you leave this place. Jao! Go! If you need money, I will give it to you. You must go!”\n\nI didn’t say anything. I just thought in my heart, “Well, Maharajji, you are so great. I have no need of going there. You are God. You can cure her.”\n\nHe immediately replied to my thoughts, “No, no, you must go! Badmash! This is my order!” I kept mum. He said, “Don’t you know? The doctor is a great saint. The moment she has his darshan she will be all right. You see his grace, you go to him, there will be no need of medicine. You see him. She will be all right. You go! Tomorrow you will have to go! Don’t deny it!” I had been thinking that I would not go. “What? You don’t obey my orders? Obey my orders! You are very wicked. You have to go.”\n\nWell, I was thinking, it is a great trouble to me, but he says I have to go, and so I must go. The next day, I thought he would direct me to go, but he didn’t say anything about it. He said, “Well, come here, sit beside me. How many people are coming to the temple? Give them prasad, give them whatever they need.” But he didn’t say anything about going to Agra. From that day, even till now—eight years—my wife has had no pain.\n\nIN HIS EARLIER years, in some of the villages on the plains of India, Maharajji became well-known for his curing of insane people. In those days many such people would be brought in chains to Maharajji to be helped. In the later years he would do much less of this and often had such people taken to a temple known as Bala-ji Hanuman; yet still, with a word or a glance or a pointing of the finger, he could straighten that which in the mind was crooked.\n\nAn Indian man had brought his widowed mother who had been emotionally and physically destitute since her husband’s death. She had been a devotee of Maharajji for many years but it seemed she saw him only rarely, so her son brought her to Maharajji hoping that this would help her. When Maharajji came out, I was troubled to see that the man and his mother were standing way in the back and that all the area near Maharajji was taken up by the young Westerners.\n\nI got up the nerve to be a busybody and ask people to move aside so that these people could come forward. People did move, instantly. Then Maharajji took the widow into the small room, where she stayed with him for some time. She came out a different person, really radiant. I was impressed by that, and her son and granddaughter were very moved, too.",

    "content": "Once a Western devotee stood before Maharajji in a rage of defiance. He was drug-intoxicated and came to believe that he himself was Jesus Christ and that Maharajji needed to repent. Before many other devotees there, this fellow shouted his defiance. Maharajji silently engaged the fellow’s gaze for a few moments, with a look of openness and compassion. The man still continued his tirade, so Maharajji nodded his head and then told some devotees to throw him out. Even after he was outside, Maharajji sent more devotees out to be sure that he had gotten on the bus and left town. (Later, when asked how he had felt during this time, the man said he felt engulfed with Maharajji’s love and was especially touched that he would send people out to help him board the bus.)\n\nMAHARJJI DID NOT heal all who came to him with illness or who prayed to be healed. Why some were healed and others were not was known only to him. Sometimes he would apparently lessen the illness but leave the individual with some of the suffering. His comments at these times suggest that Maharajji’s healing acts were intimately related to the karma of the individual—that often it was necessary for the person to suffer part or perhaps all of the pain of the illness. While most people do not want to suffer, Maharajji now and then reminded his devotees that suffering brings us closer to God.\n\nWhen my daughter was born she was very sickly. I took her to an allopath and to an ayurved (doctor of herbal medicine), but no one could help. I took her to an astrologer, who said, “She has three planets indicating death. If she lives past two-and-a-half then bring her to me for her chart. Now it is useless.” Then I brought her to Maharajji and asked his help. Maharajji just bent his head down on his arm and hid his face for some time. For about five minutes he concentrated. Then he picked up his head and said, “Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.” After that darshan, my daughter caught pneumonia again and again, but she lived. She is now six years old. I don’t worry about her. What comes now is karma and we must deal with it.",

In the winter it came back again very intensely, but I didn’t do anything for it. I want to keep the pain to remind me of that day. It was the last darshan I had of Maharajji.\n\nYOU GET WISDOM FROM SUFFERING. YOU ARE ALONE WITH GOD WHEN YOU ARE SICK, IN THE CREMATION GROUND OR HOSPITAL. YOU CALL ON GOD WHEN YOU SUFFER.\n\nAGAIN FOR REASONS known only to Maharajji, sometimes he would seem to bargain with death and push it away from one of his devotees, while at other times he would not intercede and the devotee would die. Because Maharajji knew the time of each person’s death, but hated to be the bearer of bad news, he would often be absent at the time when one of his devotees must die. In some cases, when pressed, he gave a subtle clue, but often it was merely his absence that was the clue for the devotees who had come to know his ways.\n\nOnce a neighbor lady came to my wife and said she was going for the darshan of another local baba. She asked my wife to accompany her, so my wife went along. The neighbor showed her hand to the baba, as he was considered an expert in palmistry, astrology, and such things. But the baba said, “I don’t want to see your hand; I want to see her (my wife’s) hand.” She didn’t want to show it, but he insisted and he told her that she would die in six months.\n\nMy wife told this to Maharajji, who immediately exclaimed, “Sub gulat (It’s all wrong)! Why did that baba say that? Will you not die? A time will not come when you will die? Everybody will die! Why didn’t you say to him, ‘What—will you not die? Are you immortal?’ He will also die. Everybody will die. Why does he say such things? It’s very bad that he says such things. Wicked!”\n\nThen Maharajji narrated another story about a saint. I was there to hear it.\n\n“Well, there was a saint. A woman came to see him. Her husband had just died. She bowed to his lotus feet, and he gave her his blessing and told her that she would have five sons. She said, ‘But Maharaj, I have come to you because my husband has just died. How will I have five sons?’ The saint replied, ‘I have told you that you will have five sons and I will keep my word.’ And her husband came back to life.” Then Maharajji said, “And I will do the same thing. Since I have given my word, I will complete it. You will not die. You will live for seventy-five years. Don’t be worried.” That was eight years ago. She is still alive.",

The doctors wired us that he would die that very day, that he was in the absolute, final stage of cancer. We were all very sad. I went to Jaunapur (Maharajji’s new temple in New Delhi), thinking that if Maharajji is really as great a saint as they say, he could help us. Out of the merit of his own tapasya (austerities) he could help us. So I went and prayed for three things: First, I prayed that my brother-in-law’s life be extended for two more months. I wouldn’t ask for a cure (what is ordained must be; a ravaged body must die), but an extension could be granted. Second, I asked that he die here, surrounded by his family. Third, I asked that he have a peaceful death.\n\nNext we heard from Bombay, and they said he’d had a remission and was released from their care. He came immediately to Delhi to join us. Here, the doctors examined him and declared him fit enough to return to work! Well, this remission lasted for two months and one day, until he got sick again and died peacefully, surrounded by all of us. Why did he get that one more day?

CS, meanwhile, was soaping and washing Maharajji and kidding with him, but this was in his mind as he was doing so. As he went to tie the dhoti on Maharajji, he experienced that there was nothing within it. And at the moment he had this thought, Maharajji turned and yelled at him, “Get out, get out, I’ll tie my own dhoti.”\n\nThe extraordinary postures into which Maharajji placed his body were no more random than anything else he did. Some of his older devotees got quite proficient in reading Maharajii’s body language, for many of the positions were actual mudras that gave blessings, activated certain powers, or brought about certain changes in the environment.\n\nSiddhi Ma was holding a picture of Maharajji in which he is lying on his side, a classic pretzel, with one hand on top of his head. She said that this mudra of hand on top of head means: “Don’t worry about anything. I’ve got everything under control.”\n\nSometimes his devotees apparently pulled upon him from two places that were quite distant from one another. At such times, rather than disappoint anyone Maharajji would demonstrate one of his neatest talents—that of appearing in two places at once.\n\nOnce Maharajji went to a barber to have his beard shaved. As the barber was working, he told Maharajji that his son had run away some time ago and that he did not know where he was. He was missing him terribly and worried about him. Maharajji’s face was only half shaved, the other half still lathered up, but Maharajji insisted that he must go out just then and urinate. He returned shortly, the shave was finished, and Maharajji left. The next day, the barber’s son returned to his father with a strange story. He had been living in a town over one hundred miles away, and the day before, this fat man, whose beard was only half shaved, had come running up to him in the hotel in which he worked.

To this the physicist replied, “That’s impossible. The basis of physics is that something cannot be in two places at once.”\n\n“But you see,” I said, “Maharajji did it anyway.” (R.D.)\n\nTHERE HAVE BEEN no explanations from Maharajji himself about the play of his body. However, this story suggests another reality in which, at least to Maharajji, it made perfect sense.\n\nOnce when we were in the mountains during a very cold spell, Maharajji put on nine sweaters. Later, at bedtime, he said, “You people think I do this for worldly reasons. Don’t be silly,” and he took off all the sweaters and the blanket and slept all night with nothing on.\n\nONCE YOU CAN allow for these phenomena that Maharajji manifested with his body, it is difficult to return to your concept of him as an ordinary mortal. But he put up a good fight to convince us of just that. He demonstrated some vanity, illness, aging (though the stories below suggest some confusion on that), and, ultimately, death. But for the devotees, all of this was just more of his play.\n\nWhen Maharajji visited us on one occasion, he noticed a picture of himself in which he is laughing and in which his beard is quite long. He began abusing me, asking me why I hadn’t told him his beard had grown so much. Why hadn’t I had him cut it? “Now,” he said, “it has ruined the whole picture!”",

Being very happy that a Western doctor had managed to get some balm for this poor old man who had a headache, I raced back to Maharajji, tripping over the devotees sitting in front of him, lunged over to him, and handed him the little container. And he said, “Oh, doctor! Your medicine is so good! This is wonderful! This is exactly the medicine I wanted!” He looked at it and tried unsuccessfully to open it.

I pointed out each one to Maharajji: “Here’s the homeopathic medicine. Here’s the ayurvedic medicine. And here’s the Western medicine.” (The latter was Vitamin C, aspirin, and Dristan.)\n\nHe threw aside the homeopathic and ayurvedic medicines and said, “This is the medicine I want.” And he gobbled up the Vitamin C, the aspirin, and the Dristan.\n\nVery often he’d say to me, “You know, Western medicine is very good.” And he’d call me Doctor America.",

    "content": "MAHARAJJI GAVE NO formal teachings. Yet his every manifestation—every word, glance, gesture, movement—taught those of us who were open to him in ways that often bypassed our intellect and were heard directly by our hearts.\n\nMany topics came up in Maharajji’s dealings with his devotees: truth; money and poverty; anger; drugs; sex, family, and marriage; pilgrimages, rituals, saints, and sadhana; service and surrender; and, of course, love. In Maharajji’s infiniteness we found messages about all these matters—messages to guide us, not always without confusion, on our journey back home to God.\n\nBecause Maharajji, in his mirrorlike way, responded from moment to moment to those around him and to their unique karmic predicaments, someone seeking a general teaching about a topic through a collection of his utterances and the stories about him would undoubtedly be confused. At one moment he would say one thing and a moment later the reverse.\n\nBut each person was on a different stage of the journey and thus needed a different teaching. And in this river of contradiction that flowed from him, in these teachings that are no teachings, there is more profound guidance than a simplistic “do this” and “do that.” There is the continuous reminder of the existence of the spirit, and that what appears to us in this world is not as it seems.\n\nTo see, to hear, even to know about such a being who is “in the world but not of the world” is more than teaching; it is grace.\n\nMaharajji was talking in a room with only a few people, and to one man the talk appeared meaningless. He said, “Babaji, you should give instructions and lessons to people.” Maharajji didn’t answer. “Sometimes,” the man went on, “give us answers and teach us something.” Again Maharajji didn’t answer him. The man repeated his statement a third time.\n\nObviously irritated, Maharajji shouted, “What are the instructions? What is this? What are the lessons? This is all foolishness! Lessons!” Turning to the men standing there—one was a goldsmith, one a shopkeeper, one a clerk, and one a teacher—Maharajji asked each how he would pass the following day. Each man gave a similar reply, saying that he would go to work as usual, would pass the day in his habitual manner. Maharajji said, “So many people are here and they’ll all do what they have to do tomorrow and they have all preplanned it. What’s the use of giving a particular teaching? You’ll do what you want. So what are teachings? There is no use forcing anything on anybody. No matter what I say, you’ll still do what you want to do. Yet you want me to dictate something. These teachings have got no meaning. There is no use in teaching people. It is the Almighty who teaches everybody—they all come well taught. Teachings are nothing.

Why should I stop them?”\n\n“NONATTACHMENT FOR sense-objects is liberation; love for sense-objects is bondage. Such verily is knowledge. Now do as you please.” This quotation from an ancient Hindu text, the Ashtavakra Gita (XV: 3), most succinctly conveys Maharajji’s teachings about attachment. He showed in his own life that what pleased him was to have nothing to be attached to and thus be free to be with God. In his earlier years he had wandered about wearing only one cloth, carrying a piece of broken clay pot that served both as a water pot and an eating dish. In later years he still wore only a simple dhoti, but with a blanket, and now and then an undershirt or sweater or socks in the freezing mountain nights. The rooms in which he stayed were a stark reminder of nonattachment. There was only the tucket and a water pot. Nothing else.\n\nHe reminded us to be unattached to things, to people, to our work, and even to righteousness. Some he goaded to more and more renunciation, while others he counseled to be patient and gentle in the process of becoming free.\n\nMAHARAJJI QUOTED: “Aye thei Hari bhajan koo, oothan lage kapas [I had come to realize God and sing his praises, but as soon as I came out of the womb I began collecting cotton fruit (the fruit that when ripe and good-looking disintegrates at the touch)].”\n\nATTACHMENT IS THE STRONGEST BLOCK TO REALIZATION.\n\nIF YOU DESIRE A MANGO AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH, YOU’LL BE BORN AN INSECT. IF YOU EVEN DESIRE THE NEXT BREATH, YOU WILL TAKE BIRTH AGAIN.\n\nHE QUOTED, “IF THE CLAY IN A POT IS UNBAKED, THEN WHEN THE POT BREAKS, THE CLAY IS REUSED. BUT IF THE POT IS BAKED, THEN WHEN IT BREAKS, IT IS THROWN AWAY.”\n\nLUST, GREED, ANGER, ATTACHMENT— THESE ARE ALL PATHS TO HELL.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT MAKE IT EMPTY, HOW WILL YOU FILL IT UP AGAIN?\n\nIF YOU WANT TO SEE GOD, KILL DESIRES. DESIRES ARE IN THE MIND. WHEN YOU HAVE A DESIRE FOR SOMETHING, DON’T ACT ON IT AND IT WILL GO AWAY. IF YOU DESIRE TO DRINK THIS CUP OF TEA, DON’T, AND THE DESIRE FOR IT WILL FALL AWAY.\n\nSAINTS AND BIRDS DON’T COLLECT. SAINTS GIVE AWAY WHAT THEY HAVE.\n\nHE CHIDED: “THIS WORLD IS ALL ATTACHMENT YET YOU GET WORRIED BECAUSE YOU ARE ATTACHED.”\n\nMaharajji said to Dada, who was the head of a family of devotees, “You have become entirely mine. What is family to you? You are a fakir. You need only two chapattis a day and those I will give you. What is attachment for the saints and mahatmas?” The family became upset at this, but Maharajji said that if Dada realized the truth of what he said, then there was no need for him to leave them.",

As I was walking up the trail I thought about eating the apple. Apples are juicy and clean, and anything clean in India is important. I also thought about how there are no stones in an apple (something you can appreciate after you have eaten rice with stones in it). Just the fact that something can be born without a stone in it—there’s a nice quality to it, kind of friendly.\n\nWhen I finally reached the kuti the desire had become manifest, something really tangible. We tend to think that a desire is somehow much subtler than a table, but at that time it struck me that desire was the most real thing in my universe. Suddenly I understood about the process of bringing what’s called prasad, or a gift, to a saint. In the Gita it is said that if you offer only a flower in the heart of devotion it’s like the purest gift you can give. At that moment I wanted to offer the desire as my prasad.\n\nI saved the apple, and the next day, because I came to the temple earlier than most people, I put my apple on the tucket. In the course of the morning, before Maharajji came out, many people arrived and soon the apple was buried under other fruit, flowers, sweets, and so forth. But I kept my eye on the apple. About a half hour later Maharajji came out, shuffled through all these offerings, pulled out my apple, and flipped it to me.",

    "content": "I had given the first copy of Be Here Now to Maharajji when it arrived. He had asked one of his devotees to put it inside his room, and I had heard nothing more about it. Five months later I was called from the back of the temple. When I arrived at Maharajji’s tucket he was holding the book. His first comment was, “You are printing lies.”\n\n“I didn’t realize that, Maharajji. Everything in the book I thought was true.”\n\n“No, there are lies,” he said accusingly.\n\n“That’s terrible,” I said. But I was confused because I wasn’t sure whether he was serious, so I asked, “What lies, Maharajji?”\n\n“You say here that Hari Dass built the temples.”\n\n“Well, I thought that he did.”\n\nAt that point Maharajji beckoned to an Indian man who was sitting nearby and asked him, “What did you have to do with the temples?”\n\n“I built them, Maharajji.” Maharajji looked at me as if this proved that I had lied.\n\nThen Maharajji said, “And you said Hari Dass went into the jungle at eight years of age.” Again he called another man forward, who ascertained that Hari Dass had worked as a clerk in the forestry department for some years.\n\nAll I could lamely say was, “Well, someone had told me that he went into the jungle when he was eight years old.”\n\nAgain and again Maharajji confronted me with things I had said that were not true.\n\nFinally Maharajji said, “You believe everything people tell you. You are a simple person. Most Westerners would have checked. What will you do about these untruths?”\n\nMy mind spun. What could I do about it? The first printing of thirty thousand was already in the stores and certainly couldn’t be called back, but Steve Durkee had written that they were about to print another thirty thousand. So I said, “Well, I could write and have the lies deleted for the next printing.”\n\n“Fine. You do that. It will hurt you if you are connected with lies.” And with that he turned to other matters. I surveyed the damage in the book and prepared a letter for Steve at the Lama Foundation in New Mexico where the book was published. It would only be necessary to delete two entire paragraphs. Although the changes seemed of minor importance, I considered Be Here Now to be Maharajji’s book, and if Maharajji wanted it changed, it had to be changed.\n\nAbout two weeks later I received the reply from Steve, who said that the changes couldn’t be made in the next printing. When he received my letter at Lama, which is up in the mountains north of Taos, he had just returned from visiting the printer in Albuquerque. On that visit he had arranged for the reprinting, and the printer, as a favor, was going to rush the job and put it on the press the next day. The press would print, cut, and assemble the entire book in one continuous process. Steve had then done other business for two days on the way back to Lama, and though he hadn’t spoken to the printer (because there are no phones at Lama), he was sure that the job had been done. But he assured me that the changes would be made in the following printing, which would probably occur in three or four months.\n\nWith the letter in my jhola (shoulder bag) I took an early morning bus to Kainchi. As I entered the temple, Maharajji yelled, “What does the letter say?” It always struck me as humorous when he did that, for if he knew there was a letter he obviously knew what it said. He just wanted me to tell him. So I reported, and when I had finished he said, “Do it now.” I repeated the explanation patiently about the Web press and that the changes couldn’t be made for these thirty thousand copies. And he repeated, “Do it now.” I explained that it would mean throwing out all thirty thousand books and a loss of at least ten thousand dollars. Maharajji’s retort was, “Money and truth have nothing to do with one another. Do it now. When you printed it first you thought it was true, but once you know it isn’t you can’t print lies. It will hurt you.”\n\nWell, if Maharajji wanted it changed now, then that’s the way it would be. It would mean the loss to Lama of all the profits, and they weren’t going to be overjoyed about that; but, after all, the entire sum of money came from Maharajji anyway. Although it was not yet 9:00 A.M., Maharajji sent me from the temple, telling me again to, “Do it now.”\n\nI thumbed a ride back to Nainital and cabled Steve with the new instructions. About a week later I received the reply from Steve. He reported that the strangest thing had happened. When he had gone to the post office, my cable was there, and in the same mail was a letter from the printer. It seems that immediately after Steve had left, he had proceeded as promised to put the plates for reprinting the book on the press. But the printer found one plate of one page—a full-page photograph of Maharajji—missing. So he went to the files, thinking he would get the original and make a new plate, and much to his surprise he found that the original of that page was also missing. Not knowing what to do, the printer pulled the job off the press and was holding it for further instructions. So, Steve concluded, it took only a phone call to change the two paragraphs, not ten thousand dollars as I had feared. I rushed back to Maharajji with the news, but that day and the next he never gave me a chance to speak.",

    "content": "In Allahabad, Maharajji caught me in what we in the West call “a little white lie.” We were gathered around him, and in the group was an important official of the state supreme court. For the first time in all the years I had been with Maharajji, I heard him telling the official what an important person I was in the United States, that I was a professor and wrote books. All of that seemed so irrelevant when I was around him, and it sounded strange to hear him plugging my Western social-power virtues. When he stopped, the supreme court official said to me, “I am honored to meet you. Perhaps you would like to visit the supreme court.” The dual fact that I came from a family of lawyers and that I was in India in order to immerse myself in the spirit, made the entire prospect of such a visit unappealing to me. And yet, he was an important person and I couldn’t just say what I had been thinking. So I said, rather ambiguously, “That would be very nice.” At that, the official said, “Would tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. be convenient?” I was trapped, and I could think of only one way of escape. I said, “We’ll have to ask my guru. It’s up to him.” So the official asked Maharajji, and he answered, “If Ram Dass says it would be nice, he should go.” And then he looked at me in a way that could only be interpreted as, “Got you again.” The story of the next day’s events shows that even simple people like me do learn. I visited the court with this gentleman, and in the course of the visit we stopped in the chambers of the law review, where the lawyers all hang out. It was at the time of Nixon’s dramatic approaches to China. When all these lawyers saw an American with this important official they surrounded me and questioned me about Nixon’s China policy, which was of considerable concern to India. I gave as erudite an answer as my reading of the situation would allow. That evening when I was once again at darshan with Maharajji, another dignified-looking gentleman, who turned out to be the leading lawyer in the city, took me aside and asked if I would be willing to address the Rotary Club and the Bar Association. I got a sinking feeling that if I didn’t watch my step I would be on the creamed vegetable circuit of India. And remembering the entrapment of the day before, I said, “I’d prefer not to speak before either of these groups, but of course I will do whatever Maharajji says.” So the lawyer pleaded his case before Maharajji, and Maharajji seemed delighted at the invitations. He kept repeating them to all who would listen as if to imply that such invitations were a major coup, a great breakthrough, and very important. I began to feel betrayed by Maharajji. Then Maharajji turned to me and asked, “What are you going to speak about?” I thought quickly and grasped at the only association that came to mind: “I’ll talk about law and the dharma.” “Aha!” said Maharajji, “and will you talk about Christ?” “Of course.” “And Hanuman?” “Certainly.” “And me?” “Absolutely.” By this time the lawyer was looking a little green about the gills, and he interjected, “Well, we thought he might talk about Nixon’s China policy, Maharajji.” Maharajji looked shocked. “Oh, no! Ram Dass could not do that. He can only speak about God.” The lawyer then backed off, saying, “Well, that wouldn’t be quite appropriate. Perhaps I can gather a few lawyers at my home to talk about God.” Needless to say, he never did. I had learned my lesson. Maharajji would back me up when I spoke the truth, no matter how difficult it might be. In the intervening years I have often found myself about to lecture to one or another secular group and wondering what I should say. Then I hear the reminder, “He can only speak about God.” (R.D.) IN CONTRADICTION TO all of these teachings, however, Maharajji frequently lied. Because of this, when Maharajji predicted something no one knew whether it would actually happen. Although his lying was pointed out by those in the local communities who did not like him (and there were a number, because he was so outspoken), such inconsistencies made no difference for the devotees. For us, perhaps the lesson was that a free being has his or her own rules; but until you are free, you’d best tell the truth. Maharajji would usually agree to any request from a devotee. People frequently invited him to come and bless their homes and to partake of the food prepared by the family. He would inevitably agree to all these requests, yet more often than not he wouldn’t go.",

    "title": "Let Go of Attachment to Gain True Abundance",
    "content": "“KANCHAN (GOLD),” Maharajji would say and shake his finger. That and sexual desire were the two main obstacles to realizing God. Again and again Maharajji warned about these fatal attractions, these clingings; but how few of us could hear him. He referred to the Western devotees as kings. Most of us had come from comfortable economic backgrounds and so we knew that financial security would not in itself bring liberation from suffering. To know such a thing was a great step forward on the path. Many of the Indian devotees had known only financial hardship and deprivation, and for those people it was often hard to hear that worldly security was not one and the same as freedom. Yet there were some devotees who, though they had never tasted of material security, seemed to have no concern with such matters. It was as if they were truly born for God.\n\nTo each person Maharajji reacted in a different way about money. To those for whom the attachment to gold was not the primary obstacle, he never mentioned the subject. With others he talked about money all the time, awakening in the devotee both paranoia and greed, rooting out, perhaps, the sticky karma of that particular attachment. Most frequently Maharajji seemed to be suggesting that people keep as much as they needed to maintain their responsibilities to body, to family, and to community, and distribute the rest to the poor. He kept reminding us that if we did that and trusted in God, all would be taken care of. Sometimes he gave us a rupee or two, which seemed at the time like he was giving us a boon of future financial security. Some of the devotees held on to those rupees and have never since known financial need. Others gave the rupees away immediately to the first beggar they met; those devotees have not known need, either. Such a boon is known as the “blessing of Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth).” Such a blessing was clearly Maharajji’s to bestow.\n\nIn 1969 I wrote to KK, asking if I could send some money to Maharajji. The answer from Maharajji, delivered to me in a letter from KK, read: “We do not require any money. India is a bird of gold. We have learned ‘giving’ not ‘taking.’ We cannot attain God as long as we have got attachments for these two: (1) gold and (2) women (in Hindi, ‘Kamini’). No two swords can be put into one sheath; the more we sacrifice (tyaga), the more we gain….\n\nIF YOU HAVE ENOUGH FAITH YOU CAN GIVE UP MONEY AND POSSESSIONS. GOD WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR YOUR SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT.\n\nA tiny, gnarled old woman came for Maharajji’s darshan. She was, I think, from one of the local farms. Tottering up onto the porch, she touched Maharajji’s feet with her head and sat down. Then with much difficulty she unknotted the end of her sari and took from it some crumpled rupee notes and pushed them across the tucket toward Maharajji. I had never seen anyone give Maharajji money and I watched with some discomfort, for this woman was obviously as poor as the proverbial church mouse. Maharajji pushed the money back at her and indicated that she was to take it back. With no expression she reached for the money and started to put it back into her sari. The full meaning of the situation escaped me, for I understood too little of the culture to appreciate what was happening.\n\nBut then Maharajji seemed to have a second thought and demanded the money back from the Ma. Again with arthritic hands she untied the corner of the sari and handed him the bills. There were two one-rupee notes and one two-rupee note. (Four rupees were worth about forty US cents). Maharajji took them from her and immediately handed them to me. I didn’t know what to do. Here I was a “rich Westerner” (in India even poor Westerners are “rich Westerners” because of the relative values of the economies), with a private car (a rare luxury in India) and traveler’s checks. I just couldn’t accept this money. But when I tried to hand it back to the woman, Maharajji refused to allow it. I was told to keep it.\n\nThat night I put the four rupees on my puja table and reflected on them for a long time, but no great clarity was forthcoming. Later, one Indian devotee told me that I should hold onto the money, that if I did I would never want.\n\nDuring that period an old Sikh couple had taken to visiting me at the hotel. They ran a tiny dried fruit store and were obviously very poor. Yet each time they came they brought me offerings of dried fruit, kneeled at my feet, and told me in great detail of their hardships in life. Why they had taken it into their heads that I could help them, spiritually or materially, I have no idea, but they kept coming. Then one day they told me that due to illness they must leave this region and move to the plains, where their financial predicament was going to be, if anything, more precarious. I felt that I wanted to give them something for their journey, but nothing came immediately to mind. Then I thought of the four rupees. I got one of the rupees and explained to them how it had come to me and that if they held on to it, everything would be all right with them. They left Nainital and I have not heard from them since. I still have three of the rupees. And thus far I’ve always had more than enough money. (R.D.)",

Balaram folded it up, sealed it, and mailed it, and when Harinam replied, he said he’d send money and that he thought it had been nice of us to enclose the two-rupee note, but why had we put it there? We had not put any two-rupee note in that letter, and as far as I know, Maharajji never mentioned it. This was one of the little money tricks he liked to play.\n\nMONEY IS NEVER A PROBLEM.

He said, “What would you give me?”\n\nI said, “Baba, I’d give you everything I have.” This had something to do with his previous conversation, when he’d called me over to make a point in the conversation he was having with these Indians.\n\nHe turned to the Indians to say something like, “Do you see this? Did you hear that?” Then he scooped up the apples from the pattal that KK was holding, and with his hands he lowered them into my hands and said, “With these apples, I’m going to give you many dollars.” He said “dollars” in English.

Whatever grains and foodstuffs that he had gathered in preparation for the marriage ceremony were consumed by these people, and in this way he got a lot of money.",

Maharajji had never come to their home, a palatial mansion, and on one of his visits they insisted he come. He came with a crowd of people. The family did puja and then served a magnificent feast of many rare delicacies. They tried to instruct Maharajji as to what to eat first, followed by this, then that. Maharajji put everything—sweets, curries, fruits, vegetables—into one bowl, mixed them together, and ate. When he was finished he took the wealthy man’s driver, of whom he was very fond (who had also driven him to Amarkantak, a trip of many days), and drove away. Maharajji said to him, “Now let’s go to your house.”\n\nThe driver, who lived in a slum hut in a very poor section of Kanpur, couldn’t believe Maharajji, but he was insistent. Upon reaching there, Maharajji said, “I’m hungry. Bring me food.” Being very poor, they had nothing in the house. The family had already eaten and preparing rotis would take time. Maharajji said, “No, there’s gur (crude brown sugar) in that jar.

    "content": "A rich man who had come for darshan was asking Maharajji to give him his blessings in order that he get wealthy. This is what Maharajji said: “Look, you’re already stinking rich. I’m not going to give you any blessings that you get rich.” This man wanted blessings to be as rich as Tata (one of the richest men in India).\n\nMaharajji started to tell the story of Birla (another very wealthy Indian). Birla had been an ordinary guy who also had gone to his guru and asked to be made the richest man in India. His guru had told Birla to wait and serve, so Birla started serving his guru—cleaning the shit, washing the dhotis, this and that. Years and years passed but still his guru made no mention of giving him the blessing of bottomless wealth. For ten years Birla had faithfully served his guru, never again mentioning his desire.\n\nOne day the guru called Birla in and said, “Okay. Here it is,” and he took a lota and urinated in it. “Take this lota of piss. Cover it and get on the train to Calcutta. When you get to Calcutta, get off the train. When you get off the train, drink the piss. This is the blessing.”\n\nSo Birla faithfully obeyed. When he got to Calcutta, he drank the urine, which by that time had miraculously transformed itself into nectar, so I presume he didn’t have to gag. One thing led to another, and he became the richest man in India.\n\nAfter hearing this story, the rich man said, “Maharajji, Maharajji! Let me drink your piss!”\n\n“Nay, nay, nay, nay. I won’t give you any piss.”\n\n“Anything, anything! Give me your piss!”\n\nAnd Maharajji said, “Oh, no. I won’t bless you for wealth. I will only bless your grandsons. I won’t bless you. You’ve already got enough.”\n\n“Okay, okay. Do it. Do it. Anything.”\n\nThis went on until Maharajji finally relented and said, “I won’t give you any urine. I’ll give you a piece of roti.” Maharajji then asked us, “Has anybody got any roti? Anybody got any roti?” I had earlier gotten a little piece of roti; I had taken a bite out of it and kept the rest in my hand. I gave my half-eaten piece to Maharajji, who blessed it and gave it to the rich man.\n\nHe exclaimed, “Oh, this is the greatest thing.” He was delighted.\n\nThen Maharajji went on to something else, and while he was talking, another devotee turned to the rich man and told him the bread was juth (unclean) because I had eaten some of it. All of this going on behind Maharajji’s back. The rich man gave the roti back to me—roti blessed with millionaire-hood! I ate it!",

    "content": "When I first met Maharajji I was out of money, and my plane ticket back to the West was to expire within a week. But believing that “Clinging to money is a lack of faith in God,” I stayed on. Nearly two years passed, during which time all was provided for me, but I never actually had any money. Then I found out that I had inherited a thousand dollars. I immediately offered it all to Maharajji in my heart and had the money sent to India. As I was leaving for Delhi to pick it up, I asked what I could bring Maharajji. He asked for twenty brooms and several tins of milk powder, and as I was walking out the door he called me back in and asked me to bring him a blanket. The blanket was the first thing I bought with the money.\n\nWhen I returned to Kainchi, every day Maharajji would ask me for some amount of money or other, as would the Westerners. I would always give. It was not my money. Then, when it was nearly gone, all but one twenty-dollar traveler’s check, Maharajji told me not to cash it. About a week later he sent me to Nepal and asked me to stay there for four months.\n\nOf course I now had no money. He asked a few people to give me money—altogether maybe five hundred rupees—and sent me off. In Nepal, while traveling with a companion, I lost all my rupees. We knew it was Maharajji’s doing, and as we walked back to the hostel a small boy came beaming up to us, asking if everything was all right, just the way Maharajji does. We both felt it was he. At the hostel I rediscovered the twenty dollars, and with that we returned to Kathmandu. It was in Kathmandu that we learned Maharajji had left his body.\n\nMONEY SHOULD BE USED TO HELP OTHERS.\n\nDuring the summer in Kausani, one of the Western devotees told me that he wanted to give some money to Maharajji. He had earned and inherited quite a bit of money and had been very generous in a quiet way, helping out various members of the satsang who had used up their own funds. He asked me how much I thought he ought to give to Maharajji.\n\n“Why don’t you give all your money to Maharajji?” I suggested. “Since you say that your only concern is that your money be used consciously—and if Maharajji is your guru you must accept that he is more conscious than you are—obviously he should decide what to do with your money. If he thinks you should be responsible for it, he’ll give it back to you.”\n\nBut the devotee didn’t see it that way and so he gave Maharajji about two thousand dollars. Now in our daily visits Maharajji kept querying me as to what I thought he should do with the money—Did I think it should be returned to the devotee or not?\n\nAlthough I didn’t understand the implications of any of this, I urged Maharajji to return the money to the devotee, mainly, I think, because I felt the gift reflected a lack of faith. The money was returned at that time, but I don’t know what finally happened ….(R.D.)",

People were preparing food from eight in the morning until two or three in the afternoon. The biggest millionaire in India arrived, and Maharajji immediately yelled, “Go away! I don’t want to see your face! Get out! Go away!”\n\nThe man said, “Well Maharajji, I have come with these two bags of flour for you to give to the poor, in your bhandara. Please accept.”\n\nMaharajji yelled out, “No! Go away! Don’t show me your face. Don’t come here.”\n\nWhen that man still didn’t go away, Maharajji stood up and went away himself. Still the man didn’t go. He followed Maharajji saying, “Oh Maharajji, give me some teachings. What should I do?”\n\nMaharajji replied, “What teachings should I give you? Will you follow me? If I give you teachings, will you follow me?”\n\nThe man kept mum.\n\nMaharajji said to him, “Whatever wealth you have, you give it to the poor. This is my teaching. Will you follow it?”\n\nGIVE UP MONEY, AND ALL WEALTH IS YOURS.\n\nAgain and again Maharajji reiterated that one should not be attached to money, because it just causes trouble. He was fond of telling the story of a man who made much money, whose son became so greedy for the money that he came to his father with a gun demanding some of it. Then the father said,\n\n“Take it all.”\n\nI had seen again and again in America how much trouble money made in families and what greed and bitterness could exist between a wealthy father and his children—all over money. Although I didn’t feel that way toward my father, I wasn’t oblivious to the fact that someday, at his death, I would inherit much money. Then one day Maharajji called me to him and asked, “Your father has much money?”\n\n“Yes, Maharajji.”\n\n“He is going to leave it to you?”\n\n“A share of it he will leave to me.” I thought of the pride my father had in remembering his own earlier financial hardships, due in part to his father’s untimely death, and how he had built financial security so none of his children would ever have to face what he faced.\n\n“You are not to accept your inheritance.”\n\nI had never even considered that. Knowing that I would not have personal use of this money has affected me much to the good. Though I never told my father that I would not accept my share of his inheritance, something changed between us, and his trust in me grew and grew. Ultimately he gave me his power of attorney and made me the executor of his estate. After he died I found it very easy to let go of the share of the money that he had earmarked for me. (R.D.)\n\nCLINGING TO MONEY IS A LACK OF FAITH IN GOD.\n\nJ’s brother was told by Maharajji to give all his money away. He said, “No, Maharajji, what about my family?”\n\nMaharajji said, “You’ll have so much more. Give it all to me. Give it to me.”\n\nSometimes Maharajji would send a message to Haldwani asking J’s brother to get him railroad tickets, but the brother would hide so he wouldn’t have to get the tickets. Finally Maharajji said, “I’m making my grace toward J. You are greedy. Now you’ll suffer.” At the time, J was poor and all the rest of the brothers were rich. But now J is doing well and the one brother has lost his business and has nothing.\n\nMONEY BRINGS ANXIETIES.\n\nIn earlier years Maharajji had spent time wandering with a sadhu. The sadhu started to hold on to money and entrusted some to one of his devotees to hold for him. Maharajji came to the devotee and persuaded him to use half the money for his daughter’s dowry. When the sadhu heard this he was angry with Maharajji. Then Maharajji is supposed to have said, “You are ruining yourself. Get rid of it all.” The sadhu saw that he had indeed gotten caught, and he started a huge fire and burned all his possessions. Maharajji said of him, he was a good sanyasi.",

Money is your enemy. You should not touch money.”\n\nI asked him if it wasn’t all right to keep enough money for one’s daily needs. He said that that was all right: “Keep only as much money as is necessary for your needs and distribute the rest.” Well, such an instruction gave me all the latitude I needed, for who defines “needs?”\n\nSoon Maharajji returned to our earlier conversation about my having money. \n\n“Money is your enemy. You should not touch it.” \n\n“But, Maharajji, isn’t it all right to keep enough for daily needs?” But this time he answered, “No! Money should go around a saint, not through him.” He had just filled in the loophole.\n\nWhen I returned to the hotel that night I reflected that these new instructions required some action, at least the beginning of some experiments with money, so I decided to try for a time literally not to touch money. By not having money in my pocket there would be the opportunity, each time I would usually reach into that pocket, to become conscious in the use of money. But on the other hand, I reasoned, I didn’t want to become financially dependent on others. The Indians for the most part could not afford it and neither could most of the Westerners. So, as a first experiment, I turned over to one of the Westerners all my money, and he became my “bag man.” He would pay bus fares and so forth. While I appreciated that this was not the spirit of Maharajji’s instruction, it would at least adhere to the letter of the law, “You should not touch money.” Of course, I knew Maharajji meant something more. Over the years as a result of his instruction, I still physically deal with money, but I’ve come to “touch” money with my mind less and less.

Smoked in a chillum and mixed with tobacco, charas is used extensively by a large percentage of the millions of wandering sadhus. For those who are followers of the god Shiva, smoking is part of the religious ritual. For others of a devotional bent, it is used to accentuate the emotional fervor of the devotional practices.\n\nIn his earlier years, when Maharajji was also a wandering sadhu, he undoubtedly sat in the jungle around many a fire with other sadhus and may or may not have used charas himself. And in his later years, although he himself did not use such things, he was supportive of those who did. In many instances he helped sadhus to obtain charas or arsenic (another substance used, in tiny doses, by sadhus). He took a dim view, however, toward the use of hashish by householders (i.e., those with families), often directing at them a stream of abuse, or at least kidding and constant prodding about the matter. He said that it made them forget their responsibilities. For the Westerners he generally discouraged the use of such drugs as hashish and opium as means for altering consciousness (“Food is the best intoxicant,” “love is the best medicine.”) However, to some of the Westerners who were genuinely pursuing the renunciate life of the wandering sadhu and who were habituated to smoking hashish for devotional practices, he did not discourage its use.\n\nWhile charas was a product native to India, LSD was not.

    "title": "When the quest for answers leads to unexpected truths",
    "content": "In 1967 when I first came to India, I brought with me a supply of LSD, hoping to find someone who might understand more about these substances than we did in the West. When I had met Maharajji, after some days the thought had crossed my mind that he would be a perfect person to ask. The next day after having that thought, I was called to him and he asked me immediately, “Do you have a question?”\n\nOf course, being before him was such a powerful experience that I had completely forgotten the question I had had in my mind the night before. So I looked stupid and said, “No, Maharajji, I have no question.”\n\nHe appeared irritated and said, “Where is the medicine?”\n\nI was confused but Bhagavan Das suggested, “Maybe he means the LSD.” I asked and Maharajji nodded. The bottle of LSD was in the car and I was sent to fetch it.\n\nWhen I returned I emptied the vial of pills into my hand. In addition to the LSD there were a number of other pills for this and that—diarrhea, fever, a sleeping pill, and so forth. He asked about each of these.\n\nHe asked if they gave powers. I didn’t understand at the time and thought that by “powers” perhaps he meant physical strength. I said, “No.” Later, of course, I came to understand that the word he had used, “siddhis,” means psychic powers. Then he held out his hand for the LSD. I put one pill on his palm. Each of these pills was about three hundred micrograms of very pure LSD—a solid dose for an adult. He beckoned for more, so I put a second pill in his hand—six hundred micrograms. Again he beckoned and I added yet another, making the total dosage nine hundred micrograms—certainly not a dose for beginners. Then he threw all the pills into his mouth. My reaction was one of shock mixed with the fascination of a social scientist eager to see what would happen.\n\nHe allowed me to stay for an hour—and nothing happened. Nothing whatsoever. He just laughed at me.\n\nThe whole thing had happened very fast and unexpectedly. When I returned to the United States in 1968 I told many people about this acid feat. But there had remained in me a gnawing doubt that perhaps he had been putting me on and had thrown the pills over his shoulder or palmed them, because I hadn’t actually seen them go into his mouth.\n\nThree years later, when I was back in India, he asked me one day, “Did you give me medicine when you were in India last time?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did I take it?” he asked. (Ah, there was my doubt made manifest!)\n\n“I think you did.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Oh! Jao!” and he sent me off for the evening.\n\nThe next morning I was called over to the porch in front of his room, where he sat in the mornings on a tucket. He asked, “Have you got any more of that medicine?”\n\nIt just so happened that I was still carrying a small supply of LSD for “just-in-case,” and this was obviously it. “Yes.”\n\n“Get it,” he said. So I did. In the bottle were five pills of three hundred micrograms each. One of the pills was broken. I placed them on my palm and held them out to him. He took the four unbroken pills. Then, one by one, very obviously and very deliberately, he placed each one in his mouth and swallowed it—another unspoken thought of mine now answered.\n\nAs soon as he had swallowed the last one, he asked, “Can I take water?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Hot or cold?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter.”\n\nHe started yelling for water and drank a cup when it was brought.\n\nThen he asked, “How long will it take to act?”\n\n“Anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour.”\n\nHe called for an older man, a longtime devotee who had a watch, and Maharajji held the man’s wrist, often pulling it up to him to peer at the watch. Then he asked, “Will it make me crazy?”\n\nThat seemed so bizarre to me that I could only go along with what seemed to be a gag.\n\nSo I said, “Probably.”\n\nAnd then we waited. After some time he pulled the blanket over his face, and when he came out after a moment his eyes were rolling and his mouth was ajar and he looked totally mad. I got upset. What was happening? Had I misjudged his powers? After all, he was an old man (though how old I had no idea), and I had let him take twelve hundred micrograms. Maybe last time he had thrown them away and then he read my mind and was trying to prove to me that he could do it, not realizing how strong the “medicine” really was. Guilt and anxiety poured through me. But when I looked at him again he was perfectly normal and looking at the watch.\n\nAt the end of an hour it was obvious that nothing had happened. His reactions had been a total put-on. And then he asked, “Have you got anything stronger?” I didn’t. Then he said, “These medicines were used in Kulu Valley long ago. But yogis have lost that knowledge. They were used with fasting. Nobody knows now. To take them with no effect, your mind must be firmly fixed on God. Others would be afraid to take. Many saints would not take this.” And he left it at that.",

In 1968 he had come to see me in New Hampshire and had become one of my first students of yoga. He would come and visit each week and he immediately absorbed everything I shared with him of what I had learned in India. I had eventually wanted to send him to Hari Dass for further training, but he had preferred to go to live in a cave in Arizona to continue his sadhana. I had taught him all I could, but he wrote me letters and checked in every few months during the winter of 1968/69.\n\nI didn’t hear from him for a while and later learned that he had died in the cave. His mother had shared with me his final diary entries, which were most unusual. I suspected that the final diary entry had been written while he was under the influence of LSD. The story was that he had been found dead with blood coming out of his nose and that there was blood on the wall. Perhaps he had been doing pranayam (yogic breathing practice) and had burst a blood vessel. The entries were as follows:\n\nRamana Maharshi and my guru are both navigating my maha samadhi … no worry … I am in infinite bliss … and will guide you from within … write Ram Dass and tell him the good news that I have no longer to undergo sadhana … am there…. Love, love…. I know what is happening, also the guru is with me inside … know that I left the body completely identified with Jesus…. Jesu está conmigo. Yo estoy en su corazon … con guru.\n\nI had promised his mother that when I was next with Maharajji I would ask him about her son. At the appropriate time I fetched what had been his high-school graduation picture and handed it to Maharajji. He peered at it closely and then said, “He’s not in his body.”\n\n“That’s right, Maharajji.”\n\n“He died from taking medicine.”\n\n“Aha, I thought so.” (This implied to me that he had not indeed entered true samadhi but had probably done pranayam while on LSD.)\n\nBut then Maharajji, apparently understanding my doubts, said, “No, it is all right. He will not take rebirth. He finished his work. Now he is one with Christ. He loved you very much. He cried about you.” Maharajji was silent for some time and then he added, “You should tell his mother she should not worry. He is with Christ. He is watching over her. He finished his work.” (Maharajji had quoted exactly the words of the diary, and he had showed me that under certain circumstances LSD could be the vehicle for returning to God.) Then Maharajji sat silently with eyes closed. The moment was one of great power. (R.D.)",

    "content": "On one occasion, KK invited me to join him and his cousin ML in an evening drive out to Kainchi to deliver some lamps and supplies that had been purchased at Maharajji’s instructions for a forthcoming holiday ritual. This opportunity was a delight, for never, when Maharajji was present, had I been allowed to be at the temple at Kainchi in the evening after the gates were closed.\n\nIt was a quiet time of deepening dusk and all was gentle and silent. Maharajji was sitting alone on his outdoor tucket when we arrived. ML and I joined him while KK went about his business of storing the things that we had brought. For once there was no banter or conversation of any kind. This was what I had really yearned for—the opportunity to meditate in Maharajji’s presence—for the constant drama of words and apples that usually surrounded Maharajji kept all consciousness focused on the physical plane. Although the yearning to meet him on the other planes was always strong and persistent, when the drama was in progress I lacked the discipline to ignore it thoroughly and draw my mind within, to focus on the ajna (third eye) in such a way as to bring consciousness to other planes.\n\nNow all was silent; this was the opportunity. I sat in the lotus position and brought my attention to my forehead. Almost immediately I entered into deep meditation and felt the physical plane drifting away. At this point I was vaguely aware that Maharajji had suddenly lain over on his side and was snoring. I recall a vague surprise, because from the position he was in it seemed obvious that he was not really asleep. There was little time to reflect upon this, however, for suddenly my body was shaken by violent and powerful shocks of energy, which literally made my teeth rattle. The shaking seemed to grow in intensity and the focus on my forehead faltered as the attention was drawn down to the shaking body. Immediately Maharajji sat up, turned to ML, and said, “Ask Ram Dass how much money Steven makes.”\n\nI heard the words from a great distance and also heard ML’s reply that he didn’t want to disturb me because I was meditating. However, Maharajji insisted, and ML gently shook my knee. I could feel great resistance in me to “coming down” and I tried to come down just enough to answer, “thirty thousand a year,” hoping to be allowed to go back “up.” But once down, the experience was over. It was, however, enough to show me that my discipline of mind wasn’t sufficient to work with the huge energies that Maharajji could release in me with but a snore.\n\nShortly afterward we were “jao’ed.” Just at the corner of the temple I looked back. There sat Maharajji in his blanket in the darkness, immobile as a statue. There was something unearthly about him at that moment. It wasn’t the Maharajji of the warm intimate moments; it was the remote Shiva who sits atop Mount Kailash in eternal meditation. This was that aspect of Maharajji which, like the Himalayas, seemed vast and impersonal and touched a place of great depth and innocence within me. This was the force that drew me. It was love beyond love.\n\nMEDITATE TO RAISE THE KUNDALINI. THINK ABOUT GOD; IT WILL GO RIGHT UP.\n\nTO SEE GOD, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SPECIAL EYES. OTHERWISE YOU CANNOT BEAR THE SHOCK.\n\nWhen I was a little child he used to cover my head with his blanket. I used to get some sort of vibration—from head to toe I would shiver. You can call it sensation, but sensation is a cheap word for what I felt. I cannot express that pleasure.",

    "content": "I valued meditation very highly, so when I found out that an essence meditation teacher was going to spend the summer rainy season in Kausani, a small remote village in the Himalayas, I made elaborate plans to join with three other Westerners for a quiet, intense summer of practice. When I told Maharajji of my plans, all he would say was, “If you desire.” Then he said, “Go! I’ll call you.”\n\nThe house in Kausani was perfect, and we settled in with great delight, our summer meditation fantasy seemingly assured. We dug a toilet, took turns fetching water and cooking, gazed blissfully at the Himalayas, and awaited the arrival of our teacher, Anagorika Munindra.\n\nIt was at the beginning of the second week that we heard a few Westerners had arrived in the village and were staying at a small hotel below. We all agreed that they shouldn’t be invited up to our house, for we should protect this space for the work we would commence with Munindra’s arrival. But the Westerners continued to arrive in Kausani, and they were not at all pleased to be excluded from the mountaintop. After all, Maharajji had told them to come. He had said, “Go be with Ram Dass in Kausani. That’s a beginner’s course. Not for Ram Dass.”\n\nI was furious. Maharajji knew we wanted to be alone, yet he had deliberately sent what now amounted to twenty people. We decided to stick to our original plan, no matter what!\n\nBut we had underestimated the extent of Maharajji’s lila, for on Friday of the second week a letter arrived from Munindra: “Due to several administrative matters I must take care of here in Bodh Gaya, I shall be unable to come to Kausani this summer.” There went the fantasy. Once we had surrendered the fantasy of a quiet summer of meditation, we joined with the other Westerners who had arrived in the village, moved into an ashram across the valley, and had a productive and intense summer ashram experience.\n\nWe returned to Kainchi at the end of the summer, at the call from Maharajji. As we came before him for darshan he was laughing. He said, “Ram Dass teacher, Ram Dass teacher. Buddhist teacher never came. Ram Dass teacher, Ram Dass teacher,” and he cackled and pulled on my beard. No doubt about it—the events of the summer had not been just a chance misfiring of our plans. There was a paw in the pie.

    "title": "True Connection Lies in Inner Silence and Service",
    "content": "Maharajji had instructed me to be by myself and not to speak much. He had also told me to focus upon my ajna and think of him; so one summer when we were in Kausani, some fifty miles from where Maharajji was, I remained in my room alone, fasting for five days. I had many pictures of Maharajji with me.\n\nAs I was beginning this retreat, I read a story from the Mahabharata about the Pandava brothers, of whom Arjuna was the most skilled. The brothers, so the legend goes, were jealous of Arjuna’s skill and asked their guru why he was so much more proficient. The guru said, “There is nothing so special. It’s just that he wants it more than you do.” To demonstrate, the guru gave them the task of shooting the eye of a bird with their bow and arrow. Arjuna did the task easily. Afterward, the guru asked each of the brothers what they had seen. One described the tree on which the bird sat; another described the bird and its coloring. When Arjuna was asked, he said, “I see the eye of a bird.”\n\nI wanted to see Maharajji the way Arjuna saw the eye of that bird. I needed only to make Maharajji my meditative focal point, for focusing on Maharajji would simultaneously focus the eye, the mind, and the heart. After a day or two, the pictures of Maharajji seemed to lose their value and I put them all away; yet I felt Maharajji’s presence in the room. By the fourth day I felt him so close that it was as if he were standing right behind me.\n\nThe fasting made me emotionally very sensitive, so when I began to feel that he was no longer behind me and absent from the room I became very upset. Then I realized that the absence was of Maharajji as a separate entity; for what had happened in the course of those meditative days was that Maharajji had come closer and closer, until he had gone inside of me. I felt alone; not lonely, just alone. It was a feeling of strength and clarity and fullness, but also of aloneness and silence even in the presence of sounds. It was a little like being the last person on earth. When I finally emerged from the room and was with people again, the feeling slowly left me; but I now knew that in the path of merging with Maharajji lay my freedom.\n\nKUNDALINI RESTS BELOW THE NAVEL. IT CAN BE RAISED BY THE GURU’S GRACE, BY THE GENTLE, SIMPLE TOUCH OF THE GURU’S HAND.\n\nSERVICE\n\nWHEN ASKED WHY he was surrounded by so many badmash, Maharajji said, “Only sick people come to a doctor.” And like an old and trusted family physician, Maharajji was available day and night for his devotees, and he made “house calls.” Thus Maharajji’s own behavior was a perfect model for that sadhana he most encouraged in his devotees: selfless loving service. For the householders, who composed the largest percentage of his devotees, Maharajji did not generally encourage severe austerities, nor extensive meditation practice, nor complex rituals. Rather, he guided us to karma yoga, a way of coming to God through living life as an act of devoted service. In this way Maharajji mirrored the teachings of the greatest devotional literature, as in the Ramayana, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Bible. But Maharajji made it clear that hard work alone was not the essence of the matter. Rather, it was work carried on with remembrance of God; that is, work done with love in the presence of God’s grace.\n\nOne man worked so hard in the ashram that he almost never had Maharajji’s darshan. But late one evening it so happened that, one by one, all the devotees left and Maharajji was alone on his tucket. The man then went over to sit with Maharajji. Maharajji appeared surprised, since the man never seemed to have time to have darshan. So Maharajji said to him, “What would you like?”\n\nThe man merely answered, “Atma-gyan (knowledge of the self).”\n\nMaharajji replied, “Service to all is atma-gyan.”",

    "content": "“Dada is a master of arts,” said Maharajji.\n\nDada replied, “And you are a master of abuse.”\n\nWhen Maharajji was so bad that he made the Ma’s cry, he said to them, “Only if you are strong enough to hear my abuses can you face the world.”\n\nTHE PERSON WHO IS CLOSE TO ME CAN BE SCOLDED.\n\nA SAINT NEVER GETS ANGRY.\n\nI COULD NOT GET ANGRY WITH YOU, EVEN IN A DREAM.\n\nOne day when we Westerners had been sent to the rear of the temple grounds, as was usual during the day, I decided (for sentimental reasons) to go upstairs in the building I had lived in in 1967 and sit in my old room. One of the windows of this room looked over the wall into the front part of the temple, which was otherwise not visible from the back. As I idly looked out one of these windows, my attention was caught by a sight that transfixed me at the window but also made me stand well back, so that I could not be observed from outside.\n\nDown below, at the window of Maharajji’s room, a devotee who worked in the temple and served often as our translator was crying profusely. He was obviously talking to Maharajji. Then he got up and walked back toward the rear of the temple, still in tears. When he was gone from view, Maharajji appeared in his doorway and came out into the courtyard. He stood looking like a mad lion or elephant, and though I couldn’t hear him it was obvious that he was yelling and turning this way and that with great fury. Everyone in the front courtyard seemed to be cowering. It didn’t seem “dharmic” to me. Maharajji had, after all, specifically said to me that a saint never gets angry.\n\nFeelings of betrayal rushed through me, for here was Maharajji obviously in a rage. So he wasn’t a saint either. What kind of guru was this? He said one thing and did another. I myself now became enraged and felt, for the first time since 1967, my heart turning cold toward Maharajji; and the thought came to me that apparently I’d have to leave Maharajji and go it alone. I stumbled back downstairs, deeply disappointed, and sat with the others but said nothing. Later I learned that right after the scene that I had witnessed, Maharajji apparently walked back into his room, called Dada, and in a very conversational tone asked, “Did Ram Dass see me get angry?” Dada said he didn’t think so. But Maharajji insisted that I had and sent him back with a message.\n\nWhen Dada found me sitting sullenly, he said, “Maharajji wants to know if you saw him get angry.”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“Well, he said to tell you that if you have any questions they will be answered later.” And he left.\n\nA few moments later the crying devotee appeared, bag in hand, to tell us that he had been banished from the temple, supposedly, as we later learned, for letting forty pounds of potatoes go bad in the storeroom. He said tearful goodbyes and left. Now this fellow was not particularly competent, and though he was sweet he was rather a nuisance. Normally I would not have been unhappy to see him go, for he was constantly trying to ingratiate himself with the Westerners. Under these circumstances, however, I suddenly felt compelled to support the underdog. I got up and followed him out to the front of the temple. Just going out to the front unbidden was already an act of insurrection. And as this crestfallen fellow was leaving the temple gate I purposely went up to him, embraced him, and gave him some money and a note with my address in Delhi if he needed anything. Then as he left I walked defiantly back through the temple, like the showdown scene from the movie High Noon. Everyone realized that I had sided against Maharajji.\n\nAll day I waited, but no clarification was forthcoming. As usual, we were not called to the front of the temple until a few minutes before the departure of the last bus. At the time one of the couples was having some marital difficulties, and Maharajji spoke directly to them. He said they must see God in each other and give up their anger. I sneered inside, remembering the scene I had just witnessed. Then he paraphrased the words of Kabir: “Do what you do with another person, but never put him out of your heart,” and as he spoke he looked directly and forcefully at me. The words burned into my heart and I heard them in a moment as applying to the married couple, to Maharajji’s behavior with the devotee, and to my own reactions to the scene I had witnessed. Once again I had gotten caught in the mellow drama and had forgotten to remember the illusion—and behind it, the love. He never said anything else about this incident, which made what he did say all the more powerful.",

    "content": "I once found myself becoming very angry while at Maharajji’s temple. Most of the anger was directed against my fellow Western devotees. Although there were perhaps some justifiable reasons for the anger, the fever pitch to which it had risen at the end of the two weeks was surprising, even to me. It was at that point that I walked to the temple and arrived late.\n\nAll the Westerners were sitting in the usual row on the porch, on the opposite side of the ashram courtyard from where Maharajji was sitting. From here they could watch him from a distance while they were taking prasad (lunch in this case). When I arrived and sat down, one of the Westerners brought over a leaf plate of food that had been saved for me. And at that moment the fury broke and I took the leaf plate and threw it. From across the courtyard, Maharajji watched.\n\nAlmost immediately I was summoned to his presence, and I crossed the yard and knelt before him.\n\n“Something troubling you?” he asked.\n\n“Yes,” I said, looking over at all the Westerners. “I can’t stand adharma (behaviors which take people away from God). I can’t stand it in them (pointing to the Westerners), and I can’t stand it in me. In fact, I can’t stand anybody at all except you.” And as I looked at him, I felt that he was my only safe harbor in this darkness of my soul, and I began to cry. No, not just to cry but to wail. Maharajji patted me vigorously on the head and sent for milk, and when I could see through my tears, I saw that he was crying, too.\n\nHe fed me the milk and asked me if I loved him. I assured him that I did. Then, when I had composed myself sufficiently, he leaned up close and said, “I told you to love everybody.”\n\n“Yes, Maharajji, but you also told me to tell the truth. And the truth is that I just don’t love everybody.” Then Maharajji came even closer, so that we were practically nose to nose, and he said, “Love everyone and tell the truth.”\n\nThe way he said it left no doubt about the way it was to be. For a fleeting moment I had an image of a casket—apparently symbolic of my death—but it was shaped in a way that was unlike my body. It seemed representational of this conversation in which, in effect, I was protesting that who I thought I was could not love everyone and tell the truth, and Maharajji was saying, “When you finish being who you think you are, this is who you will be. When you die you will be reborn to love everyone and tell the truth.”\n\nThen he said, “Sometimes the most anger reflects the strongest love.”\n\nLooking across the yard at those Westerners, toward all of whom I self-righteously felt anger, I saw suddenly that the anger was at one level, while immediately beneath that, at a slightly deeper level, was incredible love—two planes of relationship in which a person might say, “I love you but I don’t like you.” And if Maharajji’s instructions were to be carried out—and there was no doubt that they were, for he was my guru for better or worse—the anger would have to be given up to make way for the love.\n\nThen Maharajji offered me a bargain: “You must polish the mirror free of anger to see God. If you give up a little anger each day, I will help you.” This seemed to be a deal that was more than fair. I readily accepted. And he’s been true to his end of the bargain.\n\nIt is now twenty-three years since that day. The impurities haven’t fallen away as quickly as I would have liked, but slowly, verrrry slowly, they are.",

    "content": "I was once very angry at another devotee in the ashram, and I went directly to Maharajji, who was sitting on a stone by the roadside, for help. I knelt before him and put my head at his feet. He placed his hand on my head and kept me in that position for the entire darshan. When it was time to go, he helped me up. My knees were bruised and deeply marked from the coarse gravel I had been kneeling on. I had not felt it the entire time. My anger was gone.\n\nFORGIVENESS IS THE GREATEST WEAPON, BECAUSE A SAINT SO ARMED IS UNPERTURBABLE. HE CAN GIVE UP ANGER IMMEDIATELY.\n\nA young fellow once came and Maharajji asked him how he was, and he said, “Oh, Maharajji, I’ve overcome anger.” Maharajji said, “Oh, very good!” and kept praising him.\n\nAt the time, there was another fellow present who had been asking Maharajji for many years to come to his house, but Maharajji had never come because the boy’s father didn’t believe in sadhus or saints. But now Maharajji turned to this boy and said, “Do you still want me to come to your house?”\n\nThe boy said, “Yes, but let me arrange it with my father.” Maharajji said, “Go and then we will all come.” The visit would mean, of course, that the place of honor in the house would be given to Maharajji so the father would have to sit someplace else.\n\nFinally, the whole party went and Maharajji sat on the tucket belonging to the boy’s father. Then Maharajji leaned over and looked the father in the eye and said, “You’re a great saint.” But in Hindi he used the very personal form, which you use only to very intimate friends and to people in the lower caste. So it was really an insult to use that form to the old father. The old man got upset but held himself together. A little time passed and Maharajji leaned over again and said, “You’re a great saint.” By this time the father’s face got red and he was getting worked up, but he still kept control. A few minutes more went by and Maharajji leaned over and said the same thing again. This time the father completely lost it. He got up and started screaming at Maharajji, “You’re no saint, you just come in and eat people’s food, you take their beds, and you’re a phony.”\n\nAt this point the young fellow who had overcome anger leaped to his feet, grabbed the father by the collar, and started shaking him, saying, “Shut up, you don’t know who you’re talking to. He’s a great saint; if you don’t shut up I’ll kill you.”\n\nAt this point Maharajji got up, looked around bewildered, and said, “What’s the matter, what’s the matter, don’t they want me here? We should go—they don’t want me here.” So he got up and started walking out, and he turned to the young fellow as he was going out and said, “It’s very difficult to overcome anger. Some of the greatest saints don’t overcome anger.”\n\nThe fellow said, “But Maharajji, he was abusing you.”\n\n“That’s right, he was abusing me. Why were you angry?”\n\nTHE LANGUAGE OF THE HEART\n\nMAHARAJJI LOVED TO have the Sunderakand chapter from the Ramayana read aloud. At one point in the story, a message is brought to Sita (wife and devotee) from Ram (husband and God), from whom she has been separated. Ram is telling of his torment in being separated from such a pure devotee: “One’s agony is assuaged to some extent even by speaking of it; but to whom shall I speak about it? For there is no one who will understand. The reality about the chord of love that binds you and me, dear, is known to my soul alone; and my soul ever abides with you. Know this to be the essence of my love.” When this section was read, tears would roll down Maharajji’s cheeks, and often he would become immersed in a state of bliss.\n\nIt was just this quality of love that bound us to Maharajji. Within and beyond the apples, the kindnesses, the kidding, the comings and goings, the abuses, was the love. Now and then he spoke of love, but always, he is love.\n\nOne devotee said, “He knows the language of our hearts.”",

I thought to myself, “Maharajji, how can you bear this boring man? Why do you put up with him at all?” Slowly, I began to experience the most incredible love welling up in my being, greater and greater love until I felt my heart would burst. Just then Maharajji simply put his hand on my head, and the sensation stopped. When I tried once more to recapture it, I couldn’t. I looked up at Maharajji and he was smiling at me, filled with compassion. I felt like weeping.\n\nTHE HEART NEVER GROWS OLD.\n\nI desired to have Maharajji come to visit my home but kept putting off asking him. I had told Dada of my desire, hoping that he could help me to invite Maharajji. I had just met Maharajji for the first time a few weeks before. One day I was standing outside the window where Maharajji was, when he called me in. Just he and Dada were in the room. As I entered, I felt myself transcend into some other state of consciousness and was aware mostly of a great opening in the region of my heart chakra—but it was as a gaping, empty blackness. I could barely see with my eyes or hear with my ears, and I’m sure my mouth was hanging open. My eyes went unblinking.\n\nThe two were talking. Maharajji would look at me and speak to Dada, and Dada would translate what was said. Maharajji was saying he couldn’t come visit me because the people in the village where I was staying were all very wicked and they had no love for him. Then he sent me out of the room. Afterward, when I returned to my more habitual consciousness, I felt as though Maharajji meant that he could not come visit my heart, as it was filled with worldly desires and had no room for love of him—and that as a result of that darshan, he had cleared out my heart so that he indeed could come flooding in.\n\nCLEANSE THE MIRROR OF YOUR HEART AND YOU WILL SEE GOD.\n\nEVEN IF A PERSON HURTS YOU, GIVE HIM LOVE. THE WORST PUNISHMENT IS TO THROW SOMEONE OUT OF YOUR HEART. YOU SHOULD LOVE EVERYONE AS GOD, AND LOVE EACH OTHER. IF YOU CANNOT LOVE EACH OTHER, YOU CANNOT ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL.\n\nKUMBHAK (RETENTION OF BREATH) CAN BE ATTAINED THROUGH BHAKTI (DEVOTION) ALSO.

BUTTER ONLY MELTS WHEN YOU PUT IT NEAR THE FIRE, BUT A SAINT’S HEART MELTS WHEN ANYONE ELSE’S HEART COMES NEAR THE FIRE.\n\n—MAHARAJJI QUOTING KABIR\n\nWhen asked to relate some stories of Maharajji, a devotee said, “I’ve been with him only a short time (twenty-eight years), so I don’t know any stories. What therefore can I tell? All I know is that he gave my family a special kind of love, which, because it lies beyond words and form, cannot be expressed.",

    "content": "ALTHOUGH HE MOVED about constantly, Maharajji was still a family man on many levels, though preeminently it was God’s family with which he identified.\n\nALL WOMEN ARE MOTHERS AND SISTERS, AND ALL MEN FATHERS AND BROTHERS IN GOD’S FAMILY.\n\nTHE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS YOUR HOME. ALL ARE YOUR FAMILY.\n\nThe way in which Maharajji said such things often conveyed the impression that he, who intimately understood reincarnation, was sharing with us a literal truth about our relationships with one another across births.\n\nOn the more mundane level, Maharajji was very much like a grandfather, especially to the Indian devotees. And as such he frequently gave counsel about family matters. The gist of this counseling was clearly to keep the family unit strong by properly honoring the roles involved.\n\nA WIFE MUST SERVE GOD BY SERVING HER HUSBAND.\n\nMaharajji most often instructed women to be loyal and patient, that this is what kept the marriages together, no matter whether a man was bad or good. For example, a wealthy family came with a modern daughter dressed in a pants suit (unusual in India), who had left her husband. Maharajji said in front of everyone, “Yes, he was wrong, but you shouldn’t have been so impatient and gotten so angry.” Maharajji was very hard on the young woman. He felt that if cultural changes occurred such that women no longer held the family together, all would be lost. He said, “This is why we don’t have divorces.”\n\nWOMEN ARE HIGHER THAN YOGIS IF THEY ARE LOYAL TO THEIR HUSBANDS.\n\n“You don’t even care about your old father,” Maharajji said to a devotee. “Every day you should take sweets to your father. If a man has a father and mother, he needs no God. It is easy to pray to a murti but hard when the murti speaks back.” Then he made the man hold his ears (an Indian form of promising, similar to “cross your heart”) and promise that every day he would attend to his father and bring him sweets. The next evening the father came to Maharajji. “What is this?” Maharajji said, “Your son loves and serves you and you do nothing for him. You should make your son a new suit. He is your devotee.”",

When I was between the ages of twenty-five and thirty, Maharajji would tell me not to get married and told people that I was tubercular or had cancer, and that I was dying. In my thirtieth year, Maharajji asked me, “Do you want to get married?”\n\n“No,” I answered. Maharajji then admired my shirt and asked to have it. He asked what sort of shirts I had before I started college, and I replied that I had only one old, torn shirt, but it served the purpose. Maharajji then asked how many I had now, and I said twelve. When asked why I had so many, I replied that as a teacher in public school, I had to maintain a certain code of dress or I’d be fired. Maharajji said, “No, no it is not this. Now you want to get married. You could have done with one shirt. If I ask you to marry, what will you do?” I told him, in that case I’d have to marry, but the responsibility would be Maharajji’s. For eight days Maharajji continued to press for my marriage.\n\nOn the eighth morning, Maharajji set off to catch the train. On the way to the station, he turned off the road to a young woman’s house and beckoned me to go in with him. There was kirtan going on and Maharajji was sitting in the puja room. I was called in and so was the young woman. Maharajji asked if I’d marry this girl, but I refused. Maharajji said, “If I ask you to?” I replied that the responsibility would be Maharajji’s. First Maharajji said, “I’ll not do it.” Then he said, “All right, all right. I’ll solemnize the marriage!” He put tilaks on our foreheads and said, “There, I’ve got you married! Do you accept it?”\n\nLater Maharajji said, “Don’t think that I or you have done this. God plays the lila in his own way. No role of mine, none of yours. It was to happen!” My wife and I have been very happy, for over twenty-five years.",

    "content": "Siddhi Ma one day described the marriage lila of one of Maharajji’s long time devotees. On the very day of this man’s marriage (which Maharajji had arranged and insisted upon, to the man’s objection), the man sat before Maharajji and would not leave him. But Maharajji insisted so forcibly that at last the man was taken and dressed in groom’s garb and seated on a horse for the ride to the bride’s home. As he was riding through the jungle he spied Maharajji wandering there, and he leaped off his horse and ran to him. Again Maharajji forced him to return and continue with the marriage. (The man, whose children are now being married, reports that this marriage was a spiritual boon and freed him from many misconceptions. Only after marriage, he reports, did his sadhana truly begin.)\n\nOn hearing this story, another devotee told of a man whose marriage was all arranged, and on the wedding day the groom’s procession passed by Kainchi. The groom saw that Maharajji was there and so stopped off, with the intention of obtaining his blessings before continuing on. To his surprise, Maharajji instead detained him, refusing to let him continue to the bride’s home. And the man never married.\n\nALTHOUGH MAHARAJJI was formal and traditional in his reactions to the Indian marriages, he obviously recognized vast cultural differences in the marriage mores of his Western devotees. Some he pressed continually to marry, asking them again and again and offering to them as a partner, one choice after another. In a few instances he took two relative strangers and announced that they were now married or should marry.\n\nSometimes Maharajji talked about a certain union so much with two potential partners that they psychologically accepted the match as fait accompli. Then Maharajji would never mention the matter again and the marriage would not happen. Sometimes, when such an arranged marriage didn’t seem to “take,” he dissolved it with alacrity.\n\nThree times, Maharajji asked me if I wanted to get married. The first time was with Ian. Every evening after darshan we’d walk the two miles up that beautiful Kainchi Valley to our houses in Ninglat. Ian was such an astral being that when I was with him everything was magic—roses and winged fairies. One night when Ian came over to my house there was just a lot of sexual energy in the air. I turned it away since it really wasn’t the time or the place. But after he left my whole body was alive with desire. I just lay there with it and tried to think of Maharajji. The next morning the minute I entered the temple for darshan, Maharajji called me right into the room, where he was sitting with Dada. Maharajji asked me, “Do you want to get married?”\n\nI said, “No.”\n\nHe said, “Do you want to marry Ian?”\n\n“No, no.” I wasn’t horrified; there was simply no question in my mind. I hadn’t even made a connection between this darshan and the night before. Maybe there wasn’t one. But as Maharajji was asking me he looked deeply at me, as if to study my whole being, and then he turned around to Dada and said, “She’s very good.” And then he hit me on the head and said, “You’re very good. Don’t get married, Jao.” I started to get up and then he said, “Sit down.” He hit me on the head again and said again, “You’re very good. Don’t get married, Jao,” and again another time before I left.\n\nThe second time he asked me whether I wanted to get married was after I had hitchhiked from Vrindaban to Kainchi with Carlos Vishwanath. It was an overnight trip and we had slept on the platform of some train station. When we arrived in Kainchi, Maharajji pulled me into his room right away and asked, “Do you want to marry Vishwanath?” Again, there was no question in my mind.\n\nSo Maharajji said, “Accha, good. Don’t get married, Jao.”\n\nThe third time occurred when another devotee playfully said to Maharajji, “Saraswati isn’t married yet. You haven’t married her off yet. You should marry her to Ravi Das (Michael).”\n\nMaharajji said “Accha? That’s very good. Bring her here.” When I appeared he asked me, “Do you want to marry Ravi Das?” The devotee started laughing.\n\nI said, “But Maharajji, he’s like my father.” So Maharajji said, “Accha, very good. Don’t get married,” and he sent me out again. Then he called in Ravi Das and asked him the same question about me. Ravi Das’s reply was, “Maharajji, I only want to marry you.”",

If you wish, you will have sons and sons and sons.” When my wife was again pregnant, about seven months, Maharajji was in Kainchi and he said, “Well, Siddhi Ma! Shiv Singh has a son! A son is born there.” But he was not born yet. Two months later our son was born. We put him on Maharajji’s lap: “Maharajji, this is your fruit.”\n\nHe blessed the boy and said, “You will have sons now. God has no scarcity of sons in his regime. You will go on producing sons now. Now, no daughters. Sons and sons.”",

After one stop at an apple orchard, we went up into the mountains to a rest house owned by the forestry service. The servants there obviously were expecting us and were delighted at Maharajji’s presence. Maharajji went immediately into the building, which appeared to consist of one large room, and Gurudatt Sharma went inside with him. We all sat out on the lawn, then Gurudatt called me. I ran in and found Maharajji sitting on a tucket and I knelt at his feet. Only the three of us were present. Maharajji looked closely at me, then closed his eyes for a moment and said, “You make many people laugh in America.”  I thought of my lecture style, which consisted of much humor, and I replied, “Yes, I guess so.” “You like to feed children.”  (H’m. That was a strange one.) I love to cook for people and I certainly like children, so I said, “Yes, I guess so.”  Then he reached toward me and tapped me three times on the forehead.  The next thing I recall is Gurudatt Sharma leading me by the arm out the door and the brilliance of the light outside. A few minutes later we all piled back into the Land Rover and returned to the temple.  What was that all about? Was it an initiation? What had happened to me? I recalled the story of Ramakrishna touching Vivekananda on the chest with his foot and putting him into samadhi, until Vivekananda yelled, “But what about my family?”—for they were dependent upon him. At that point Ramakrishna removed his foot and Vivekananda returned to normal consciousness.  Was this a similar event? Many months later, in a letter to me in America, Hari Dass said, “That day you were in a very high state. When you came outside, tears were streaming down your cheeks.” I don’t remember that at all.  Over the years since then, I have asked many devotees about that incident but have never received a clear answer. Some said it was a boon; others pointed out that Maharajji was in the habit of masking important initiations so that they looked like nothing had happened. Another devotee told me that the guru could awaken the kundalini energy in a devotee with a touch. The matter is still not clear. At the time it only seemed to increase my confusion—but that was Maharajji’s way. (R.D.)",

    "content": "I had been teaching in America but felt that my impurities were contaminating my teaching, so when I came before Maharajji in 1971, I asked that he make me pure enough to serve him in sharing the dharma in the West. At the time he hit me on the head and said, “You will be.” That seemed like a true boon and I accepted it as such. But some months later when I was still in India I continued to be aware of and often overwhelmed by my impurities. So again I asked Maharajji to make me pure. At that time he looked me over carefully and said, “I don’t see any impurities.”\n\nWell and good for him to say that—after all, he saw God in everyone—but I wasn’t satisfied. I wanted to feel pure. At any rate, I persisted in complaining. Then one day I was called into a back room, into which I had never been before, where Maharajji remained at night. Maharajji was on his tucket and S. L. Sah, who was a great Ramayana student and had become my deep friend and trusted teacher, was also present. Maharajji asked me what I wanted, and I said that I just wanted to be pure enough to serve him.\n\nThen he went under his blanket. There were strange movements under the blanket followed by some snoring. I felt deep peace, and curiosity as well. Then he came out from under the blanket and tapped me on the head and said, “You will be.” Later, SL said that under the blanket Maharajji had been doing mudras.\n\nShortly before that incident Maharajji was reported to have said to KK about me, “I’m going to do something for him.” Perhaps this was another of those underplayed initiations. Nobody seemed to know; Maharajji didn’t say; and I still felt impure.\n\nOn the last day I was with Maharajji, I said, “Maharajji, you promised me that I would be pure enough to do work in the West and I don’t feel that I am.”\n\nMaharajji looked mildly interested in that observation, then handed me a mango which he had been holding and said, “Here, eat this.”\n\nI had often heard about Maharajji giving boons to people, sometimes by means of a piece of fruit. At the first opportunity I went into the latrine to eat the mango so that I wouldn’t have to share it with anybody. I debated whether to hold on to the seed to get more mango boons, but finally I discarded that plan as being too “clever.”\n\nIt is now more than twenty years since that day, and slowly, very slowly, the impurities have been falling away.",

Such play on Maharajji’s part, of course, created some consternation and confusion among devotees and also grounds for criticism on the part of people who did not like or trust Maharajji. But for the women devotees who were directly involved with Maharajji in this way, his actions served as a catalyst to catapult them to God.\n\nOnce, when Maharajji was entering a room, the Mothers decided to hide behind the door so he wouldn’t see them.

    "title": "Letting Go of Attachments to Discover True Freedom",
    "content": "At all the temples, women and men slept separately unless they were married. One night Maharajji sent one married couple and a single man and woman to stay at a two-room forestry guest house we sometimes used. I assumed that the Westerners would appreciate the temple policy, the women sharing one room and the men another. The next morning I found out that a man and woman had slept in each room. I was angry with them and told them that they were insensitive to this culture. We were all immediately called to Maharajji, who asked how everyone had slept, and, turning to the people who had stayed at the guest house, he asked them who had slept in what room. They told him and he simply said, “Very good.”\n\nMaharajji repeated a number of times, “Ram Dass should not touch women. Women are like a snake for Ram Dass.” Apparently he was well aware that I, for one, could not see all women as the Divine Mother; in fact, my own fear of women had led me to seek out relationships with men. His warning didn’t help in this matter. \n\nBut his strongest injunction, which he repeated over and over again, with much finger-pointing, was, “Ram Dass, kanchankamini (gold and women).” Each time Maharajji would say this phrase—often used in the literature and by other saints such as Ramakrishna to warn people about the pitfalls of attachment to sex and money—I would review the ways in which I was still clinging to those desires. And though the desires were deep, deep within me, it was apparent that they were on a collision course with the desire for enlightenment and that sooner or later they were bound to lose. But I guess I was (am?) like the abbot of a monastery who prayed, “God, let me be free of desires so I can be like the desert fathers—but not just yet.” I wanted to play with the sex and money just a bit more.\n\nBut Maharajji wouldn’t relent. Often I would be called from the back of the temple compound many times a day. Each time I would kneel before Maharajji and he would look pointedly at me and intone “kanchankamini,” and then send me back. It almost sounded as if he were warning me about something specific, but at that time I interpreted it as a general admonition to get on with it. I tried a variety of ways to free myself from the bonds of lust. I offered the lust into the fire in various rituals and asked God through a variety of religious metaphors to take this attachment from me. But apparently I was not ready to be free, for the attachment to these desires remained.\n\nIn 1974 I met a woman spiritual teacher who explained to me that she was sent by Maharajji (astrally) to help me with my inner work. The major part of our work together turned into sexual tantric practices. It proved very helpful in loosening the bonds of attachment to desire with which I had been struggling.\n\nIn the course of our work together she seemed to have a difficult time staying in her body. Her consciousness kept floating away. Because it had been suggested that the precious metal gold would help to “keep her down,” I decided to buy her a bracelet and ring of gold. It was in the jewelry store that I recalled Maharajji’s repeated admonition to me about “women and gold.” Shortly afterward I felt that much of my fear of women had been dissipated through this relationship, allowing my attachment to lust to be loosened so that I would get on with my spiritual journey, and I left those teachings. It felt like Maharajji’s grace had brought me to this woman, and it was through his grace that I left her. (R.D.)",

    "title": "True surrender arises when you let go of self and trust the guidance within",
    "content": "THE EVER-SO-SUBTLE relationship between the guru and the devotee is much dependent upon faith. The deeper the faith and trust the devotee has in the guru, the more readily are spiritual qualities awakened in the devotee through the guru.\n\nIn the spiritual literature, the true surrender is spoken of as the surrender that is no surrender. That is, one opens—through faith and trust—to a method such as a guru only when such faith resonates with truth at the depths of one’s being. Then there is a readiness for such opening. If one is still rooted only in intellect or emotion, any act of surrender is but another act of ego and can, based on misjudgment, lead to horrendous consequences. So one cannot choose to surrender to the guru. But when the devotee and the guru have met at the depths of being, then such surrender is not actually surrender to another person but, rather, surrender to one’s own God-nature.\n\nThere is a story concerning surrender told by Maharajji’s devotees about another saint, Sombari Maharaj, very highly regarded by Maharajji, who had lived at an earlier time.\n\nIt seems that he gave one of his devotees two potatoes and instructed him to eat both of them. The instructions were very firm. The man went down near the stream and began eating one of the potatoes. Shortly thereafter a very poor old man came along and begged for the other potato, saying, “You have food and I have none.” The devotee could not refuse and so he gave the second potato away. When he returned, Sombari Maharaj abused him roundly for not doing what he had been told. The harangue ended in, “So it was not your bhagya (more than luck, perhaps destiny) to take the second potato.” Later the man became very successful in the world but not successful in his final spiritual efforts in life—for that was the second potato.\n\nSuch a story, which seems to pit charity against surrender to the guru, is a hard teaching indeed. However, we must learn finally to surrender self-conscious charity in order to become charity itself.\n\nSome of the stories concerning the total faith and resulting surrender of the Indian devotees around Maharajji are awesome indeed, and some of their failures of faith are equally awesome. Maharajji didn’t make it any easier for any of us devotees, because he continually sowed seeds of doubt about himself to undercut any flickering faith we might be developing. Still, we watched as our doubts became consumed into an ever-deepening trust. He seemed to be leading us to the realization, once expressed by Ramana Maharshi, that “God, Guru, and Self are One.” Thus we found that trust and opening to Maharajji led us only to a deeper part of our own beings and a deeper faith in ourselves.\n\nMAHARAJJI SOWS SEEDS OF DOUBT\n\nI recall once bringing to Maharajji a new Westerner, someone I liked and whom I wanted to be impressed by Maharajji—that is, I wanted Maharajji to do his “tricks.” Maharajji looked at him and said, “You come from Canada?”\n\n“No, Maharajji. I come from the United States.”\n\nMaharajji nodded as if he had now placed him and said, “You have three sisters.”\n\n“No, Maharajji, I’m an only child.”\n\nBy this time I was getting very uncomfortable. But Maharajji kept it up, questioning him incorrectly about his journey and his work and then dismissing us. The fellow looked at me as he left, and said, with slight pity, “I’m sure your guru is very nice.” He never returned. (R.D.)",

    "content": "On my second visit to India in 1971, I had met Maharajji at Allahabad. After a few days, he sent us on to Delhi. As we were leaving, Maharajji said to me very quietly, “I’ll meet you in Vrindaban.” He didn’t specify when, and I didn’t ask. After all, if he said he’d see me in Vrindaban, then he’d see me in Vrindaban.\n\nWe spent about a week in Delhi and then decided to go on a pilgrimage of Shiva temples in the south. This trip would take us through Vrindaban, where we could see Maharajji and get his blessings.\n\nWe left Delhi and stayed the night in Mathura, preparatory to seeing Maharajji in Vrindaban the next day. With much fruit and many flowers, we arrived at the temple in the early morning. The pujari explained that Maharajji wasn’t there and it was not known when he would arrive. Even knowing of Maharajji’s notorious reputation for unpredictability, I was disappointed, for he had said, “I’ll meet you in Vrindaban.” And I knew that by the time we returned from the south sometime in April, Maharajji would, in all likelihood, be up in the mountains, since the plains in which Vrindaban was located would already be turning unpleasantly hot. What could he have meant?\n\nAt the temple that morning, I was sitting listening to some old women carrying on the continuous chant of “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama” that was heard there from early morning until late evening. A small bird flew overhead and dropped a piece of straw, which landed on my lap. Perhaps that was Maharajji and he was giving me a gift. Or perhaps I was once again just grasping at straws.\n\nAfter offering the fruit and flowers before the murti of Hanuman, we went on our way, and at the end of the pilgrimage, we proceeded north. On the journey, a great dialogue took place as to the route we should follow: If we were to go to the mountains to Nainital, there was a direct route; but to go via Vrindaban was more circuitous, requiring an extra day. We were now well into April, and most likely Maharajji would be in the hills. But then, he had said he would see me in Vrindaban, and I could still taste that disappointment when we didn’t find him there on the way south. I was in favor of going directly to the mountains, but I was outvoted and we went on toward Vrindaban.\n\nAgain we spent the night at Mathura, and the next morning brought fruit and flowers, though this time in slightly less abundance, because our expectations of finding him were weak indeed. We dallied in the marketplace to enjoy freshly squeezed fruit juices and finally, at about eight-thirty, headed for the temple. When we arrived it seemed ominously deserted. We parked before the main gate and went in. The pujari met us. After we pranammed to him, we asked if Maharajji was here.\n\n“Oh, no,” he answered, “Maharajji hasn’t been here for weeks. He’s probably up in the mountains now. He’s not here.” Our collective heart sank, but we offered the fruit and flowers to Hanuman, and after no more than five minutes in the temple, we hastened back to the car, thinking that if we drove without stopping we could be in Nainital by evening. Just as we were closing the car doors, a small Fiat sedan raced down the road and stopped next to us. The driver looked vaguely familiar, and next to him sat Maharajji, who got out of the car and walked into the temple without taking any notice of us.\n\nWe rushed over to the car to find Gurudatt Sharma, Maharajji’s frequent traveling companion, sitting in the back. Sharmaji is usually friendly but quite tight-lipped about Maharajji’s business, but we did manage to extract from him that they had been in a distant city the previous evening. At 2:00 in the morning, Maharajji had awakened him and the driver and said, “Come on. We must hurry. We have to be in Vrindaban.” They had driven all night and arrived in Agra at about 7:00 A.M. Then Maharajji said, “We still have some time. We can visit so-and-so.” And after a short visit, again Maharajji rushed them on to Vrindaban. After all, he said he’d see me in Vrindaban.",

She behaved as though she were one of our family and would even go into my wife’s room and take her good saris to give away to other women. The woman stayed with us some seven days, but still Maharajji had not come, so she went to Kainchi. When Maharajji finally came to our house, she was with him. The Nainital devotees and also the Lucknow ones where she had visited all complained how she had moved in on them and given away their valuables. Maharajji asked why I had allowed her to stay at my house. I said that Maharajji had sent her. Whoever Maharajji sends is welcome in my home; I cannot turn away Maharajji’s guests. Maharajji denied sending her. I countered, “How could she have come without your knowledge?” (How could she? Maharajji knows everything, it is his house. Of course he had sent her!)\n\nThis Maharajji did not deny but countered instead with, “But she gave away your valuable things!”\n\nI replied, “They could not have been so valuable, so necessary, if we no longer have them. They must have been useless things, or we would still have them—is that not true?” Maharajji remained silent. What could he say? The other devotees were surprised that Maharajji acknowledged that he is aware of and responsible for all such things.",

    "content": "Again and again over the years, Maharajji has taught me to have faith that he will guide me through my own heart. I need only listen to that higher intuitive sense. That’s when I feel him the most. Here is an example of how he taught me this:\n\nAmong the sadhus in Vrindaban was a handsome young sadhu who spoke some English and who had befriended many of Maharajji’s Western devotees. He would take them on pilgrimages around the town, showing them out-of-the-way temples and special holy places. In the evenings the Westerners sometimes joined him for chanting.\n\nI was invited time and again, but I felt no desire to participate; being near Maharajji each day was enough for me. The rest of the time I was content to wander about and think of him and what had transpired during the visit that day.\n\nBut this young sadhu kept sending messages inviting me to the gatherings, which I kept declining. One evening a Westerner arrived bringing a leaf plate full of food that the sadhu had sent to me. This attention made me uncomfortable. I felt distrustful of his motives, and simultaneously I felt distrustful of my own motives in distrusting him. Perhaps I was inwardly competitive with him.\n\nSoon afterward we were all told to go to Allahabad, a city some two hundred miles distant. There we were housed in a devotee’s home, and each day we visited Maharajji, who was staying at Dada’s home about a mile away. On one occasion three of us arrived at Dada’s home in a rickshaw. The house was surrounded by a fence with a gate and outside the fence was a single tree. As we drove up, sitting under the tree was the young sadhu from Vrindaban. The two Westerners who were fond of him jumped off the rickshaw, ran up, and pranammed to him. After I had paid the rickshaw, I came up to the gate. At this moment the sadhu rose and we bowed to one another. I couldn’t understand why he was sitting outside the gate. If he had come to see Maharajji why wasn’t he inside with the many others? Perhaps he was of a sect that could not enter a home. Or perhaps he needed to be invited in. Now that he had stood, was I supposed to invite him in? I couldn’t very well ignore him, go in, and leave him there. And yet something in my heart—that same discomfort I had had about him back in Vrindaban—held me back from inviting him. My distrust of his purity made it impossible for me to bring him to Maharajji.\n\nWe stood there facing each other and I was transfixed by indecision. Then suddenly an Indian man emerged from the house and with much honor and delight welcomed the sadhu and took him inside. Immediately I concluded that this sadhu was indeed pure and that my reticence was my own impurity, and so I skulked into the house and sat in the front room, heavy-heartedly singing with the others. The sadhu was nowhere to be seen. Shortly afterward I saw him among the singers and then I didn’t see him anymore. My own heart was heavy with guilt for allowing my own competitiveness or whatever it was to parade through me as an intuitive reflection about another’s impurity.\n\nThen I was called back to the kitchen area, where Maharajji sat surrounded by Indian devotees. I fell at his feet and he hit me on the head and said to the Indians, “Ram Dass speaks well, he’s a good lecturer, but he doesn’t understand people.” These words were translated and I realized that Maharajji was not going to let the scene that had taken place outside pass unnoticed. I could only agree with him and wallow more and more in my guilt and feelings of impurity. Again and again Maharajji repeated the same statement, that though I could speak well I was no judge of other people. Everyone agreed and looked at me with loving pity. I agreed again and again, most wholeheartedly. Finally, when Maharajji had milked the moment for all it was worth, he said, “Yes, he does not understand people. He would have brought that sadhu inside. And that man is not pure—he wants things of his devotees.” And with that he gave me a fierce hit on the head and laughed delightedly. My head spun, and through the clouds of guilt, self-doubt, and self-pity, suddenly came the brilliant sun of comprehension. Maharajji was, in his inimitable way, telling me that this time I had been right. He was teaching me to trust my heart.\n\nMaharajji used to quote from the Ramayana, where Ram says to a devotee, “Friend, why are you worried? Surrender by my power all thoughts to me, and all your priorities will determine themselves.” He quoted this the day he left Nainital for the last time.",

I didn’t want to go there because I wanted to spend some time alone. But when I came up, Maharajji said, “Go to Benares.”\n\nI said, “Couldn’t I please go to Ayodhya?”\n\nHe said, “No, go to Benares.” I was so foolish that I thought I could still go to Ayodhya, even though he specifically told me not to. I went to the train station and got a ticket on the Faizabad Express, which goes to Ayodhya. I rationalized that since it is kind of a triangle, I could go to Benares by way of Ayodhya. I got the ticket for the train that was to come in on track 10 at 3:00 P.M. I went to track 10 in plenty of time, but when, by 4:00 P.M., no train had come, I decided to question somebody. The conductor said that the Faizabad Express had come in on track 8 today; it had been announced in Hindi, which I don’t speak. So I’d missed the train.\n\nJust as I was standing there wondering what to do next, a train pulled in behind me. I turned around to look at it and saw, on the side of the cars, “Benares Express.” So I went to Benares. Now Benares is a pretty big place, with lots of hotels, but I went to a cheap one recommended by a friend and checked in, and as I sat in my room, I heard someone singing the Chalisa (hymn to Hanuman). It turned out to be Vishwambar. So I surrendered to that, and we spent a week together, during which we were very close.",

    "content": "We were up in the mountains visiting with Maharajji at Kainchi. The eight-year-old VW bus was doing yeoman’s service each day, moving the Western devotees from Nainital down the mountain to Kainchi each morning and back up each evening. Soon there were too many for the VW and some had to go by public bus, but still twenty or so managed to squeeze in the VW or on the rack on top, and, as VWs do, it smiled gamely and did its thing. But one day, just at the town of Bhowali, the VW stopped. It wouldn’t start again. So we left it there and the next day told Maharajji. And he said, “Take it to Delhi.” All the way to Delhi, a hundred and ninety miles away? That seemed absurd to me. Couldn’t someone local fix it? All he would say was, “Take it to Delhi.”  \n\nThat evening back in Nainital I spoke to the Sah family who owned the hotel. They knew of a mechanic, and I arranged for him to go and see the car. A day later he looked at it but could not start it. So again I told Maharajji and again he reiterated, “Take it to Delhi.” Then I told him that in Almora, thirty miles away, was a German economic project and they used VWs and had a service man. Maybe I could get him to come over. Maharajji said, “Take it to Delhi.”  \n\nI wrote to people in Almora asking them to contact the German repair center, and after letters back and forth that took the better part of two weeks, it became clear that no incentive would get the mechanic to come to Bhowali and that they weren’t even interested in looking at it if I got it to Almora. I told Maharajji all this, and you can imagine his response: “Take it to Delhi.”  \n\nSo again I went back to the mechanic in Nainital and again he went to look. This time he got it running and drove it up to Nainital, but on the outskirts of town it stopped and he could not get it going again. Enthusiastically, I reported this progress to Maharajji, but his instructions had not changed.  \n\nIt was now more than four weeks since the breakdown and it became evident that the Nainital mechanic just couldn’t fix the car. Since there was nothing else to do, it was decided to “take it to Delhi.” A truck was rented, complete with Sikh drivers, and the car was loaded aboard. With Krishna Das as passenger, they left for Delhi. Krishna Das told hair-raising tales of the journey—of the drinking and of moving the VW from one truck to another, and so forth—but finally it got to the repair man at Delhi. The VW was rolled off the truck and the repair man walked over, opened the engine compartment, took one look, connected one wire, and the car started and ran perfectly.  \n\nAfter that the term that came to be synonymous with my lack of surrender was, “Take it to Delhi.” (R.D.)  \n\nJUST AS ONE tells a child not to do something even when the consequences of the act are all too obvious, so Maharajji would warn or instruct people about this or that. But as the child insists on doing the act and one watches the inevitable effects that follow the cause, so Maharajji’s devotees would often ignore his words and Maharajji would watch … and allow. Now and then he would say, “I told you so.”  \n\nOnce Maharajji upbraided a man who had just come to visit a friend at the temple, telling him to take food in his truck and go home immediately. The man’s feelings were hurt because he thought Maharajji was insulting him. It was late at night so he slept in his truck outside the temple. When he got home, he found that his house had been robbed during the night.",

I know you’ve got more.” The sadhu gave two large pieces of the precious root. Maharajji broke these into many small pieces and gave a little piece to each devotee except one, whom he told that the root would do him great harm. The devotee pleaded for just a tiny piece of what was now Maharajji’s prasad, so Maharajji relented and gave him a piece.\n\nThat same evening, Maharajji and his devotees sang kirtan: “Sri Ram Jai Ram, Jai Jai Ram.” Maharajji sang the loudest. The devotee who had been warned not to eat the root became violently ill, left the party, and went to his room. After a short time, Maharajji came to the devotee’s room, pulled him to his feet, and brought him back to the kirtan. He again felt sick and returned to his room. Maharajji again came and brought him back. The kirtan went on until the early hours of the morning. By this time, most of the devotees had fallen asleep, but Maharajji continued to sing. Finally Maharajji allowed the sick devotee to return to his room and fall asleep. When he awoke, he found Maharajji sitting beside the bed. “Are you all right now? I told you not to eat the root.

    "content": "It was time once again to apply for a permit for a six-month extension for the VW bus. The first six-month permit that I had obtained, the previous spring, had been a week-and-a-half’s worth of hassle and had cost hundreds of dollars. Now the VW was tired, and so was I, and I wanted just to give it to the Indian government. But Maharajji would not hear of it. Rubbing my nose in my material attachments, he kept insisting that the permit should be extended. So I found myself fighting with the ministry of finance to keep a car that I didn’t even want. And explaining to them that I was doing it under orders of my guru found me few sympathetic listeners. The permit extension, which normally might be expected to take a few days, took almost three weeks. It required no less than twenty-three signatures, the final one being that of the minister of finance himself. That meant a member of the prime minister’s cabinet had to sign personally to allow me to keep one battered 1964 VW bus for six more months. Of course, this was in addition to the duty that had to be paid, which by now equaled the value of the car.\n\nDuring the first few days, I used reasoning and firmness and “justifiable anger” as the tools to make the system spit out the permit extension. But none of that worked. Once, after getting up and storming out of an office with an exit speech about “no way to treat a guest in your country,” I went back to my hotel and realized that by blowing up I had just lost a point, because there was no way around that particular office. So the next day I had to go back and apologize.\n\nAnd so it went. Once, the person whose signature was needed was attending his nephew’s wedding for a few days; at other times the application paper had been misplaced, or they couldn’t agree on the tax, or I needed two independent assessments of the value of the car …. It was necessary to go to the offices each day or the application would get lost in the bowels of that huge bureaucratic monster already totally constipated with folders and papers ominously piled from floor to ceiling. There was no way to leave Delhi.\n\nWhat a teaching about possessions! No matter how convenient the car might be, it certainly wasn’t worth all this … car-ma. I could hear Maharajji laughing at my “pile of bricks.”\n\nThere was, however, an interesting serendipitous teaching in all this. While we waited for the clearance for the car we were staying at a delightfully rundown, semi-hippie hotel. At first we lived out of our backpacks, expecting each day to be free to leave Delhi and get back to a “holy place.” But as the days went on in this exasperating process, we began to settle in. More and more Westerners passing through Delhi found their way to our room until, each day, there would be a satsang of thirty or more of us, and we would chant and meditate and talk about the spirit. Soon people were bringing Indian bedspreads as wall hangings, and pictures and fruit. The wife of the owner of the hotel was even preparing ghee for our puja lamps. Finally we were so much in the spirit that it no longer mattered if we ever left Delhi. And at this point, my visa application was filed, the permit for the car came through, and we were free to leave for Vrindaban (R.D.)",

    "content": "MAHARAJJI BEGAN his spiritual work very early in life. He told one devotee that as a small child of seven or eight he would skip school to go into the jungle to do tapasya. Wisps of information suggest that he had been born into a landed family who lived in a stone house, but that he had left the security of his home very early to wander about as a sadhu.\n\nDuring those years he traveled about dressed in only a single dhoti, and he took his food and water in a discarded fragment of a broken clay water jug, which he wore on his head like a cap. At this time, he was known as “Handi Walla Baba (the baba with the broken clay pot).”\n\nAt some stage, he passed time near Aligarh and Manpuri, where he performed spiritual practices by sitting for some time in water. The local residents knew him then as “Tikonia Walla Baba.” (“Tikonia” means a triangular-shaped reservoir.) Probably about this same time he began to pass time in the town of Neeb Karori (from which he later got the name by which we knew him). There he stayed for some time in various underground caves, coming out sometimes during the hot season to sit in a ring of fire in the hot sun.\n\nIt was not until the 1930’s that he began to appear regularly in villages in the foothills of the Himalayas and northern plains. Early on, he would play with the children and then disappear into the woods. Later he started to allow Indian householders to take him into their homes to feed him. These people were quick to recognize an extraordinary presence in him, and they began following him for his spirit and healing powers.\n\nHe was often seen visiting temples dedicated to the deity Hanuman; later he instigated the building of many such temples by his devotees. He seemed to be on a continuous religious pilgrimage and encouraged others to visit the holy shrines around India. His special affinity for Hanuman and Ram was reflected in his continuous repetition of these names of God and in the stories he both told and asked to have read to him. Yet despite his predilection for Ram and Hanuman, he honored all aspects of God and found the true spirit in all forms of worship. Obviously he had undertaken severe austerities during his own sadhana. Yet he later said that such practices were not necessary. He honored those who undertook such practices but for the most part encouraged his devotees to feed and serve people, live dharmically, and, above all, to remember and love God.\n\nMAHARAJJI’S SADHANA prescriptions were tailor-made for the individual devotee to whom they were directed.\n\nAt one point I asked Brahmachari Baba if Maharajji taught him tapasya, and I gave examples of the tapasya Maharajji is said to have done himself, such as sitting up to his neck in a lake and sitting in the summer noonday sun surrounded by four fires. Brahmachari Baba immediately said, “No. Only ordinary things such as various yoga asanas (postures) and meditations and pranayams.” With a little more questioning, he said, “Maharajji told me to be maun (silent). I was silent for three years. After that Maharajji told me to do the standing tapasya—that is to say, I must never sit or lie down, but remain always on my feet. This I did also for another three years. I performed this tapasya at Bhumiadhar before the temple complex was built. I had a special contraption to support my body for sleep. Sleep would come and my legs would swell up very big. Maharajji also told me to be phalahari (to eat no grains, only fruits and vegetables). This I did for some eight years.",

Kundalini does not necessarily manifest as outer symptoms; it can be awakened quietly.” To another one he said, “If you are going to stand on your head, take butter.

Much later, in discussing pilgrimages, Maharajji said to me: “You went to Amarnath Cave?” “Yes, Maharajji.” “But you didn’t understand it.” “No, Maharajji.” “You will.” (R.D.)",

    "content": "Accompanied by the Mothers and a few devotees and servants, Maharajji stayed in the Amarkantak dharmasalla for eleven days. Each morning after breakfast, they went to the various sacred places in the area—the temple, Kapildhara, Dudh-dhara, Sonmuda, and so forth. Often they wandered in the jungle, and Maharajji would visit with an old sadhu who lived there alone in a cave. The sadhu had a white beard and long jetta (matted hair) and extraordinarily long fingernails. He prepared rotis and fed them to Maharajji with his own hands, along with fresh milk from his cow. Maharajji commanded everyone to bathe in the sacred reservoir of Narmada Mata. He then took off his clothes and, holding the hand of a devotee, submerged three times under the water, shouting, 'It’s very cold, very cold!' as he came up. He immediately threw his blanket back on.\n\nMAHARAJJI USED names to awaken us to our deeper selves. First we were Joan, Jeff, Joe, Danny, and Barbara—and then we were the whole Hindu pantheon.\n\nThe naming of the Western devotees reflected the difference in Maharajji’s lila with men and women. While many Western men were given Das (servant) names, such as Ram Dass, Krishna Das, Balaram Das, as far as we know, no women were called Dasi, the feminine counterpart. Nothing Maharajji did was without meaning, yet the subtlety of this distinction is hard to interpret.\n\nWomen were instructed to perform acts of service as frequently as were the men, and regardless of the individual name given, Maharajji often called each woman simply, 'Ma.' Whatever our ages or conditions, we became Mothers, the role that has always encompassed loving service.\n\nYet perhaps that was not the aspect he wished to stress most; perhaps we most needed to see ourselves as goddesses, as the shakti whose first service is to her lord—who is God.",

Then Maharajji gave me a name, saying “Rukmini!” He said it very harshly, and I was very cool to it. It just wasn’t right. I felt he hadn’t given it freely, that he’d been pushed into it.

I said, “No. He sent for me to come here. He must be here.” After some time the boy begged me to give up and return; twice he did this, and both times I insisted we continue.

I stood helpless.\n\nJust then the boy called out, “There he is!” And there was Maharajji in a boat just beside us on the Ganga, with two other men. The boat came ashore and Maharajji got out and questioned me about the entire story, asking for all the details. Then we walked to where the other devotees were standing. Once there, Maharajji sent them all away except for me. He again questioned me for every detail of the story—receiving the summons, coming to the Ganga, walking along in search, the boy’s pleadings—but this time Maharajji insisted that I tell him what was in my mind at the moment of quandary with the boy.

He said, “Yes! Eat!” then I took food from him. He said, “You do your puja now.” I asked for his blessings to go, but he replied, “No, you do it here—here, in front of me.” I started my puja.\n\nMaharajji sat there talking and people kept coming and going. Three or four people who had never recited these prayers before were so charmed that they also began to recite. Maharajji turned to me and said, “Oh, you are just showing off. What is the use of fasting and all these rituals? The Lord is within you. You can’t remember him until his grace is there. If his grace is there, everything is there. Always remember him and try to acquire him. And if his grace is there ….” Then he sat still for two-and-a-half hours. The whole atmosphere was charged. Each year I had been very fastidious about that particular day, fasting, praying, and so forth, but this time he broke that.\n\nOn other occasions he wouldn’t allow me to do my puja. I told him that I wouldn’t do it if he wouldn’t allow me, but that I also wouldn’t eat until the puja was done. Then he shouted, “Close the door, you wicked man! Finish your puja! What is this puja and this troubling the Lord? Praying and fasting? Can’t you remember the Lord for a second? What good is this puja? I don’t understand!”",

After the ceremony the pujari would place a bit of this paste and a few grains of rice in the middle of each person’s forehead. The high point of the ceremony for the old priest would be the placing of the tilak on Maharajji’s forehead. Maharajji would of course be talking to people during the whole process and, invariably, just as the old pujari would apply the paste with great seriousness and concentration, Maharajji would turn his head to talk to somebody else and a smear of red would go completely across his forehead. The pujari just could never get Maharajii to sit still for the rituals.\n\nEqually as important as fire ceremonies are the ceremonial baths in the sacred Ganges River. Maharajji disrupted even these. Two old men were en route to the Ganga at mela. It is considered a very holy thing to bathe in the Ganga at this time. Maharajji commented, “No, take your bath here. Everywhere is the Ganga.”",

Maharajji sent him back without his bath, saying, “Serving people is better than a ritual bath in the Ganga.”\n\nOFTEN MAHARAJJI QUOTED: “ALL ACTION IS PRAYER. ALL TREES ARE DESIRE-FULFILLING. ALL WATER IS THE GANGA, ALL LAND IS VARANASI (ANOTHER NAME FOR BENARES). LOVE EVERYTHING.”\n\nThe lessons Maharajji taught about rituals, like so much of his teaching, were fraught with the paradox that outdistanced the rational mind. He seemed concerned that the rituals be done properly, yet he broke all the rules. But as one devotee said, “When there was work, he would set aside the rituals, and the minute the work was completed, he sent you to do puja.” But perhaps he also broke the rules, such as upsetting that fire ceremony, to show people that the thing itself was not the ritual but the spirit: Do the ritual to tune in, but don’t get caught.\n\nThere were two old men who, having raised families and done their duties, had taken sanyas and were wandering about on foot. They spent many months at the Kainchi temple, and Maharajji had them singing “Sita Ram” for several hours each morning. When it was time for them to leave, Maharajji called them in front of him and, in what appeared to be outrage, yelled at them for beating an iron pan in front of the murtis during arti. (In the scriptures, iron is not to be used in the temples.) Maharajji told them that they didn’t know how to behave properly and so he threw them out. As they turned to walk away, Maharajji broke into a grin and sang in a high falsetto voice, sweetly, “You beat the gong, and I threw you out.”",

Maharajji called in a pundit and told him to teach the boy the prayers. Then Maharajji sent him to the bazaar to buy a sacred thread and tulsi beads. Maharajji put these on him and told him to do the puja to Hanuman, that now he had become a pukka pujari (first-class priest).\n\nMaharajji had gone out one day, and J, the man who had built the temple, came and questioned B as to his caste, his knowledge of Sanskrit, and so forth. B answered that he was not a Brahmin but a Thakur (a lower Hindu caste). J was upset, and just then Maharajji appeared and called him away. J complained to Maharajji, and in the big hall in front of many people a discussion followed.\n\nMaharajji then asked B if he knew Sanskrit; if he could read the Bhagavad Gita. B said no, and Maharajji retorted, “Don’t lie.” Maharajji told J that B knew the eighteen chapters of the Gita by heart. J then asked to hear chapters eleven and twelve. Maharajji threw his blanket over B’s head and hit his head a few times. Then B began to sing the Gita in the best Sanskrit, impressing all the Brahmins. J broke down and threw himself at Maharajji’s feet. B remained pujari for a year and a half. Although he never again recited the Gita, when that boy would perform a puja he was in such communion with God that much peace would come to all.\n\nAS A PROTECTOR of the dharma, Maharajji not only kept devotees from getting lost in the rituals, but also he was quick to point out spiritual deception, fraudulence, and materialism when he would find it.\n\nOnce at a mela, Maharajji and a devotee passed a sadhu sitting as if in deep meditation, with a lota next to him. Maharajji said, “He’s a deceiver.” He told a young boy to steal the sadhu’s lota. As soon as the boy took the lota, the sadhu came out of meditation and jumped up. Maharajji yelled to the boy, “Drop it, drop it, or he’ll beat you.”",

He kept drawing us back from our concerns about individual differences, back beyond the forms, with his oft-reiterated remark, “Sub Ek (All one)!”\n\nAll religions are the same. They all lead to God. God is everybody …. The same blood flows through us all, the arms, the legs, the heart, all are the same. See no difference, see all the same.\n\nYou must honor Shiva through love.

Many Muslim mullahs (priests) and scholars attended the festival to perform the rituals and read the scriptures. When Maharajji arrived, the devotee escorted him to the place of honor in front of the scholars. They immediately ceased their singing and complained to the host.

Tears streamed down Maharajji’s cheeks, and then he went into a very blissful samadhi state. We were all overwhelmed by the quality of the moment. When the reading stopped Dada suddenly got up and led Maharajji into the other room and closed the door.\n\nMAHARAJJI NOT ONLY honored the story of Hanuman but over the years had encouraged devotees in many places in India to construct temples for the honoring of Hanuman. Some of these temples are small and located in devotees’ homes, and others are large public ones to which hundreds come each day. It is not possible to determine how many temples were constructed at Maharajji’s inspiration, if not his direct instigation. For someone so aware of the pitfalls of ritual, it seems strange that in his later years he should be so identified with temples. However, everything connected with the temples, starting with the very construction, held subtle teachings. Every temple involved much drama of one kind or another about such aspects as the acquisition of land. And these difficulties embroiled many devotees in processes that in each case intensified their own ultimate faith in the spirit.\n\nThe big temple at Nainital is constructed upon a spot where previously there was dense jungle, inhabited by wild animals. Part of the place had been used as a burial ground for very young children (who are not cremated). Local people believed the site to be haunted by ghosts. When Maharajji visited the place and indicated that he wanted to build a temple there, the local officials put up a lot of resistance. Nobody thought that a Hanuman temple could ever be built there.\n\nMaharajji just camped by the side of the road. Each day many devotees would walk out to the spot to be with him. Slowly, slowly the vibrations of the place changed. Once he pointed to a mule shed, which was the only structure near there, and said, “Here there will be a big temple and people will come from all over the world to it.” Everyone laughed because it seemed absurd. Then after some time, Maharajji had Hari Dass Baba bring to the place a small murti of Hanuman that he had made, and it was duly installed. That was the beginning of what is now a large temple complex on the top of a high hill to which people come from all over to have darshan.",

    "content": "Maharajji frequently used to visit the old Hanuman temple in Lucknow, situated on the banks of the Gomati River. The temple was built before 1960 by a devotee of Maharajji at his request. Maharajji would sit there and give darshan, and though the temple became famous, puja and bhandara to celebrate its opening were never done. Once M asked Maharajji about this, and Maharajji replied, “No, no. Not this temple. We’ll have a bigger temple.”\n\nOne day while driving Maharajji to someone’s house they passed by an old bridge which was being replaced by a big new one. Maharajji pointed toward the bank where the construction was going on and said, “There we’ll have our temple!” There was no question of doing anything. Later, when driving to Kanpur, Maharajji suddenly shouted, “A wonderful temple has been designed in Lucknow.”\n\nTwo years later there was a change in government and an old devotee became minister of public works. He came to Maharajji and suggested that the old temple was too small. Maharajji said, “As you like.” A few days later the man came by with a fine model of the present temple. Maharajji said, “Yes, make it.”\n\nWhen the new bridge was completed, the old one was abandoned. At the same time, the river began to consume the old temple. The government suggested destroying it, but Maharajji said that a temple shouldn’t be destroyed, that nature should run its course.\n\nThe government bought the temple for thirty-five thousand rupees as compensation. Maharajji asked the minister how much the new temple would cost, and he said eighty-five thousand rupees. When asked where the balance would come from, Maharajji said, “It will be made!” Six months later the government had given most of the money, and the owner of the contracting company offered to pay the balance. Then the temple was built on land that was also given by the public-works minister. Two years ago the Gomati flooded and took off the back half of the old temple complex.\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT teaching of these temples, however, is that they all contain statues of Hanuman. These statues, constructed of stone or cement, were invested through prayer, mantra, and chanting with the spirit of Hanuman, and thus they became murtis and were treated in the same way that one would treat the actual Hanuman.\n\nAs the years passed, Maharajji came to spend more and more time at these temples in the course of his wandering, and this tended to strengthen an association in the minds of the community between Hanuman and Maharajji. This association went back to the earliest stories about Maharajji, far predating the construction of the temples. Exactly what the association between Maharajji and Hanuman is, plays endlessly in the minds of devotees. He talked about Hanuman continuously and named many of us with one or another of the names used to refer to Hanuman, including those names of God to which the word “das” (servant of) was attached; and he instructed many on the path of service and devotion that would bring them ever closer to Hanuman.\n\nA man asked Maharajji, “What should I do for sadhana?” Maharajji said, “Don’t bother your head about that, just keep repeating Ram as Hanuman did.” This man was an old devotee, now retired from his livelihood work.\n\nSERVE AS HANUMAN SERVED.\n\nSOME DEVOTEES regard Maharajji’s focus on Hanuman as due to Maharajji’s being a member of a traditional devotional sect in India, in which the relation of devotee to God is like that of servant to master—with Hanuman the perfect embodiment of that form. This sect focuses its devotion upon Hanuman, the monkey-God depicted in the Ramayana as serving God (in the form of Ram) with totally concentrated one pointedness. His exploits, which reflect this devoted service, bring him into such intimacy with God that he becomes known as the “breath of Ram itself.”\n\nOther devotees see the deep intimacy that was often evidenced in Maharajji’s dealings with Hanuman as reflecting a bond between them far transcending the usual devotional forms.\n\nWhen Maharajji was staying at Neeb Karori, it is reported that he spoke to Hanuman directly, as if he were right there.",

Get a pail of milk. We’ll give him some milk.” A crowd started to gather around the room, but Maharajji had the door closed, with only three or four devotees inside.\n\nOne of the devotees thought, “I have always wanted to see how a murti is fed.”\n\nAs the devotee thought this, Maharajji turned and said, “Everyone turn around and face the wall and close your eyes.” They all did this, but the same devotee wanted so badly to see that he thought of opening his eyes anyway. As he thought this, Maharajji said, “And if you open your eyes you will be blinded.” Suddenly they all felt a change of energy in the room. They experienced through closed eyelids a brilliant light and heard the sound of drinking. When they were allowed to turn around they found the pail empty, a tiny puddle of milk on the floor, and some milk dripping from Hanuman’s mouth. Maharajji told them to collect the milk on the floor and give it out as Hanuman’s prasad.\n\nMAHRAAJJI OFTEN told the following story, which some devotees suspected was about himself:\n\nIn a small village there was a tiny Hanuman temple to which the local people would come. The practice is for a devotee to bring some sweets and offer them to the murti by giving them to the priest, who then takes the sweets into the room or alcove where the murti is and draws a curtain. Then he offers the sweets to the murti with appropriate mantras. After this the priest usually takes a few of the sweets and sets them aside to be given later to the poor neighborhood children. The rest he brings back to the devotee-donor as prasad, which the devotee then eats as a blessing from Hanuman.\n\nIt so happened that the old priest in this village was called away by illness in his family, and he left a young neighborhood boy who loved to be around the temple to take care of the temple while he was away. Soon some devotees came and brought sweets, and the boy took them as he had seen the priest do and went behind the curtain. Even though he had never been with Hanuman when the curtain was closed, he offered the sweets to the murti. But Hanuman wouldn’t take them. The boy became upset and demanded that Hanuman take some of the sweets. He even picked up a stick and began to beat the murti. Suddenly all the sweets disappeared from the dish. The boy returned to the devotees, joyfully explaining that Hanuman had accepted their offering. The devotees, who were used to receiving back a portion of their gift, concluded that the boy had decided to keep all their gift for himself, and beating the boy, they sent him away. When the old priest returned and was told about this incident, he said, “All my life I had hoped to become pure enough so that my offerings would be accepted by Hanuman. But I never was. This young boy had that purity and was so blessed.",

    "content": "I had heard about him in America and saved my money so that I could make a pilgrimage to India to meet him. I arrived at the temple with fruit, which somebody had told me to bring as an offering. The gate keeper let me in to the back, where I saw him sitting on a wooden bed, wrapped in a plaid blanket. There were a lot of Indians and Westerners sitting on the ground around him. I was a little nervous so I went along the side of the courtyard up to the bed and put down the fruit while he was looking the other way. I bowed the way I saw someone else doing it, and when I raised my head he was looking right at me. Everything just stopped for a minute. Then he said, “Jao!”\n\nMy Hindi was poor but I knew that word! It was the one I used to get rid of the beggars who had crowded around me in Delhi. It meant “Beat it!” or “Get away!” I was stunned and went through disbelief, embarrassment, anger, and guilt. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Here I’d come all this way from America and the first thing he’d said to me was “Beat it!” But then I thought, “Okay. You know best.” And he threw me back one of the pieces of fruit and said “Jao” again. Only this time it was okay; this time I heard something else. It wasn’t “Get lost!” but, “Everything’s fine. I love you. Go.”\n\nNow I can see that it all happened in those few minutes. He did whatever needed to be done; I got what I needed to get. All the times afterward when I was with him were wonderful, but they were just frosting on the cake.\n\nTHE VARIATIONS IN Maharajji’s use of the word “jao” were infinite—from a bellow (sometimes preceded by “Ap (You)!” for the recalcitrant) to a tender, “Jao, Ma …” as he gently patted a woman devotee bowing at his feet.\n\nUsually as devotees would come before him during the day, he would hand them a piece of fruit or some sweets, or ask them a question or two, and then jao them. Others would be allowed to sit with him while he gave darshan off and on through the day. It is interesting that a word seeming to imply rejection—“go away”—could be said with so much love that it came to mean “go with blessings” or “go with grace” or “go with my love.”\n\nThere was jao to another part of the ashram; jao to take food or rest; jao to go carry out some indicated duty or service; jao that might be postponed, if one could think of a good question, or even ignored, if some distraction occurred, such as new arrivals. There was the jao of disgrace and banishment for some misdeed (often followed by a giggle once the culprit had passed out of earshot).\n\nThe word became Zen-like in its all-encompassing quality and, when roared inexplicably at first sight of a devotee entering the ashram, totally Zen in its effect.\n\nJao could be for a moment or forever—to the nearby city of Nainital for the night or, most dreaded by the Westerners, maha-jao (great jao) to America. Jao could even be questioned, if one was willing to play that perilous game. For a jao might be disputed successfully; but also a jao of a week to go visit holy Benares might, on the response of a groan, be transformed to a jao of a month for a pilgrimage to Rameshwarem at the southernmost tip of India. Never was it simply “Go!” but always, “Go with love.”\n\nWe were sitting on the hill opposite the ashram with some binoculars watching Maharajji, who was sitting on the roof of the building in the back of the ashram compound. We saw an Indian man who was trying to be with Maharajji sneak up along the stairs, hold his head really low, and rush across the roof toward Maharajji. And even from that distance, though we couldn’t hear, we could certainly see the jao and the man go right back down again. “Oops, there he goes!” We were up there smoking dope and eating yogurt and having darshan with binoculars. When Maharajji found out that he was being watched with binoculars, he looked through them and he liked them.",

And he kept sobbing out the words, “Delhi, Delhi.” Of course I burst out laughing and ended up going to Delhi. One of the things Krishnamurti said with great soul-force while we were in Delhi was, “I abhor all gurus!” Perfect!",

    "content": "After a month on pilgrimage in southern India, we returned to Allahabad in the early morning hours, anticipating another long gentle round of being with Maharajji. When I came into his room at 6:30 in the morning his first words were, “Has your visa been renewed?”\n\n“I don’t know, Maharajji. I made application.”\n\n“No, it hasn’t. Jao! Go to Delhi.”\n\n“Now?” I was a bit taken aback to be thrown out before I’d even been welcomed home.\n\n“Go by the 9:30 train this morning.”\n\nOnce this devastating piece of business had been transacted, Maharajji became tenderness itself, rolling around on his tucket, handing out the rudraksha beads we had brought from Rameshwarem temple, and playfully pulling my beard and patting me. Although I tried to get him to change his mind about sending me away, I found myself back on the train at 9:30.\n\nIn Delhi Maharajji had arranged for me to receive help from a minor official in the government. And so began another round of entanglement in bureaucratic red tape. The prospects seemed to go from bad to worse. Earlier in the fall I had tried to take care of the visa extension with KK, up in the mountains. He had arranged for me to speak with the head of the visa bureau in that community. Those proceedings had gone awry and now made the work in Delhi more difficult. These machinations with KK, more or less behind Maharajji’s back, were not ignored by Maharajji, who kidded me mercilessly about how KK was now my advisor, my guru, and if I had not tried to get the visa done through KK, everything would now be all right.\n\nAs the end of February approached and the visa situation looked hopeless, I suddenly recalled the previous February when I had first seen Maharajji on this visit to India. “How long do you want to stay?” he had asked.\n\n“Forever.”\n\n“March?”\n\n“You mean next month?”\n\n“All right, a year from March.”\n\nAnd now, early in March a year later, despite all the apparent attempts of KK and Maharajji to help me, I received my “quit India” notice from the government. There was no doubt about it: Maharajji was using the government to do his dirty work. All I could do was laugh and surrender once again. He had covered every angle.\n\nGenerally I tend to cry in the presence of purity or dharma. I’m not quite sure why that is, but the feeling is that such purity is too much to bear. I also cry when I am ecstatically happy and, in rare instances, when I am very depressed. At the leave-taking from Maharajji I cried and cried, and, again, I’m not really sure why. Mrs. Soni felt great concern about my crying and said, “Don’t cry. You will be able to come back—won’t he, Maharajji?”\n\nMaharajji said, “He can come in a year … or six months.” But I wasn’t really crying because of sadness; if anything it was from joy, for Maharajji had instructed me that serving people was my dharma. My work was clear. And he seemed to be telling me to get on with it.\n\nMaharajji said two more things that day that I can remember. First he said, “I will always be in communion with you.” And the second thing was “Jao.” (R.D.)\n\nDUE TO INDIVIDUAL KARMA, PEOPLE MUST BE SENT AWAY FROM A SAINT. HOW THIS IS DONE VARIES. WHEN THE TIME FOR THE ASSOCIATION ENDS, THE SEPARATION MUST OCCUR.\n\nWithin a month, I went back to America, with absolutely no regret. I was really happy to be going. Maharajji could give you that kind of energy, so that you really didn’t mind leaving, so that you were really exuberant about going.\n\nI SEND PEOPLE AWAY BECAUSE ATTACHMENT HAPPENS BOTH WAYS.\n\nI WILL NEVER ALLOW ONE OF MY PEOPLE TO ESCAPE FROM ME.",

After that I saw him again at four o’clock in his room with two or three others. He was saying to us, “All those who come into this world must go. Nobody will stay here. They must go. Knowing this, why do people at the time of death go ‘Whooooo, whooooo?’ (He feigned great weeping) Why do they cry? They should go gladly. They should go laughing. They shouldn’t cry.” After some general talk he said, “Now I shall go. I won’t stay and I won’t give darshan anymore to anyone.”\n\nOne devotee asked, “Maharajji, where will you go that we people will not be able to get your darshan?”\n\n“Oh, too far! Too far!” Maharajji replied.\n\n“Where?” the devotee asked again.\n\n“Oh, there … near the Narmada River,” Maharajji said. (The Narmada River starts in Amarkantak, traditionally from the throat of Shiva.) The bus driver came shortly after that to take away all those people who lived elsewhere. Some man had just arrived and asked for a private darshan, but Maharajji said, “Baba Neem Karoli is dead! Who will you talk to now?”\n\nThe man laughed and said, “All right, if you order me to go then I will, but I’ll return at eight in the morning and talk with you then!”\n\nMaharajji said, “All right. You come. If I’m alive, I’ll talk to you.”\n\nOutside in the courtyard the Westerners were singing and had begun to shout in unison the traditional salutation, “Sri Sri Sri One Thousand Eight Neem Karoli Baba Santa Maharaj Ki Jai!” Inside, Maharajji commented, “Baba Neem Karoli is dead!

We awakened to find that Maharajji had left. I think Janaki said she saw him pranam to the murtis before he left.\n\nAFTER HIS DEATH in Vrindaban, Maharajji’s body was placed on a large block of ice on a verandah of the ashram. In the evening it was paraded through the streets in a litter atop a car. Thousands watched the procession, which was complete with brass band and processional lights. At about 9:00 P.M., in the courtyard of the temple, Maharajji’s body was placed on the funeral pyre.\n\nTranslation from Vrindaban newspaper, September 12, 1973:\n\nThe cremation ceremony of the earthly body of the famous and “wonderworking” saint, Baba of Neem Karoli, was performed with all the necessary religious ceremonies at his dwelling place, the ground opposite to the Sri Hanuman temple.\n\nWhile he was going from Agra to Nainital he suddenly became unwell, and after that he died of heart failure.\n\nBefore the cremation, the dead body of the baba was carried in a procession in a decorated carriage in the city. The question of the place where the last rites should be performed was solved by the Pagal Baba (Sri Lila Nand Thakur), who said that Vrindaban is the king of holy places. He further said that there cannot be any better place than this. The old Mother who came from Kainchi ashram insisted that the cremation take place either at Kainchi or at Haridwar. The pyre remained burning up until three o’clock in the morning. By then a good number of devotees had reached there to pay their last homage. There was deep sorrow in the ashram and the devotees kept coming.\n\nThe president of the All India Congress Committee, Dr. S. D. Sharma, reached Vrindaban at 6:00 A.M. and remained sitting near the cremation place for quite some time. He has been a devotee of the baba since 1957. He has advised the ashram people to collect the literature regarding the baba’s life and activities. A committee has also been formed. September 22 has been fixed as the date of the community feeding. The ashes have not been put into the Yamuna. They will be buried in his Samadhis. Some of his ashes have been preserved for immersion at several places of pilgrimage.\n\nThere is a controversy about the age of the baba. People say that his age may be between 250 and 300 years.\n\nThe inhabitants of Vrindaban were always against him. They always addressed him by the name of “Chamatkari Baba (miracle man).”\n\nAs soon as his American devotees heard the news of his death, there were a number of telephone calls from that country.\n\nBig officials of India are coming to Vrindaban to pay homage.",

    "content": "S said it was Maharajji’s lila that nobody around him at the time he died could realize that if they had spoken with true heartfelt devotion to him, “Get up, Maharajji, you are not dead,” he would have done so.\n\nTHE NEWS OF Maharajji’s death came with extraordinary swiftness to those of us who had left India, and the reactions were as varied as to any other part of his lila.\n\nDuring the summer of 1973 I was staying at my father’s farm in New Hampshire, and was there in September when the telegram arrived. My father and my stepmother, looking rather concerned, met me when I returned from shopping at the village. Dad said, “This telegram just came from India don’t understand it, but I copied it down word for word as the operator gave it to me.”\n\n“At 1:15, September 11, Babaji left his bojhay (sic) in Vrindaban ….” The telegram went on with further details. My father asked, “What does it mean?”\n\n“It means,” I said, “that Maharajji died.”\n\nThey immediately tried to console or at least commiserate with me, but their words seemed strangely irrelevant, for I felt absolutely nothing—neither sad nor happy. There was no sense of loss. Perhaps I was just numb. A couple with marital difficulties were waiting for me, so I went and sat with them and helped them unwind the tangled thread of their loves and hatreds. Every now and then in the midst of the discussion, my mind would wander and I’d think, “Maharajji isn’t in his body. Isn’t that strange,” or “I wonder what will happen now?” But I pushed such thoughts aside and forced my consciousness back to the task at hand, for, whatever was to come, there was no sense in stopping service to others.\n\nThroughout that day and many times thereafter I remembered the words of the great Ramana Maharshi. He was dying of cancer and in the past had shown power to heal others, and his devotees were now begging him to heal himself. He kept refusing, and they cried, “Don’t leave us, don’t leave us,” to which he replied, “Don’t be silly. Where could I go?”\n\nAfter all, where could Maharajji go? I had him in my heart. I had been living with him moment by moment and yet not with his physical presence—so did it really make any difference? I wasn’t sure.\n\nWhen the couple left I started calling other devotees in the United States and Canada and asked them to call others. It was agreed that those within a radius of three or four hundred miles would join me in New Hampshire. By the next noon some twenty of us were gathered. It was a peculiar meeting. We were all somewhat dumbfounded by the news and many were crying, but at the same time we were happy to be together and felt Maharajji’s presence very strongly with us. We cooked a big meal, which we ate around the fire. But before the food we went up to my room to sit before the puja table and meditate and do arti.\n\nWhile all of us sang the ancient Sanskrit prayer, we took turns offering the light (in the form of a candle flame) by waving it before Maharajji’s picture. After my turn I went to the back of the group and watched. In the reflection of the candlelight I looked at the faces of my guru brothers and sisters and saw their expressions of love and the purity of their hearts. And finally I was able to cry—not out of sadness at the loss, but rather because of the presence of that pure and perfect love that is Maharajji and which I felt in this gathering of hearts.",

Just before he “jao’ed” everyone, he explained that we were all just worshipping a clay pot. “What will happen when the clay pot breaks?” he asked. He was sending everyone to different places, people were crying, and I felt that Maharajji wanted just to split, that he was finished with the body.

    "content": "One of the amazing things that happened was at the funeral bhandara, the final Vedic ceremony, about eleven days after death, in which traditionally the soul has passed through all the bardos (planes of existence) and is free.\n\nThey had covered over the entire courtyard with tents and at one end had built a small platform on which they were going to light the sacred fire. Just as they were lighting the fire, out of the clear blue sky, from the east, came this big black cloud. And it came fast. As it was approaching, the wind was getting more intense and the canvas roofs began flapping. I remember thinking at that time, “Maharajji, if this is a sign from you, it just isn’t enough,” thinking that if he were going to come in some other form, I still wanted total immersion, total darshan.\n\nThe cloud kept approaching and the wind got stronger and stronger, and suddenly we were in the midst of a violent windstorm! The canvas was ripping in shreds, the supporting poles were snapping in two, the sacred fire was leaping high into the air. It was so exciting, so ecstatic, that people were leaping up and down, hugging each other and crying. It was recognized very quickly as Maharajji’s blessing. Then, after the storm passed by and things were going to go on, I was so filled with excitement that I went rushing into one of the rooms in the back. I don’t know why I went there, but as I rushed in I awakened Molly Scott. She’d just arrived, never having seen Maharajji alive. I burst in, filled with the excitement of this storm, waking her up. She told me later that she woke up at that moment with an entire song, melody and lyrics, in her mind. “There is no death. I feel you all about me. In every breath, I’ll never be without thee. In my heart, in my mind, in the flower, in the child, in the rain, in the wind (etc.—each verse is different), you are born anew. You are born anew.” This is the song that came from that storm.\n\nMAHARAJJI HAD SO often spoken to us about death that we had his own words to work with.\n\nAS LONG AS THE TIME DOES NOT ARRIVE, ONE CANNOT DIE.\n\nTHE BODY PASSES AWAY. EVERYTHING IS IMPERMANENT EXCEPT THE LOVE OF GOD.\n\nMaharajji used to say that bodies should be cremated because it minimizes the craving of the soul to get back into the body.

A guru is indestructible, immortal, and immune to old age and death.”\n\nWe devotees who knew Maharajji and were familiar with his lila are none too sure exactly what happened on September 11. We know a body was burned, but we are uncertain as to which of Maharajji’s bodies it was. Perhaps he had just made a thought of himself solid, so that it could be burned. He taught us not to trust our senses and minds regarding him, and we have learned our lesson well. Now we are wary of accepting even the reality of a cremated body. Thus it is not too surprising to many of us when stories start to appear suggesting that all is not as it seems.\n\nA few weeks after Maharajji’s mahasamadhi, a stranger came to the Hanuman temple in Lucknow. He questioned the priest about the beads he wore around his neck, and the priest replied they were tulsi beads that Maharajji had given to him. The stranger said that he knew Maharajji and thought that he was a great soul. He asked to be shown around the ashram, and upon entering the bedroom kept ready for Maharajji, the man pointed to an urn sitting on the bed and inquired about it. The priest realized that the man didn’t know about Maharajji’s mahasamadhi. He told him that the urn contained ashes from Maharajji’s cremation. The man was shocked and he said that this was impossible, since he had just seen Maharajji a few days earlier in Amarkantak. He said that Maharajji had worn only a burlap sack around his waist and no other clothing. Maharajji had told him that he had left his blanket in Kainchi and that from then on he wouldn’t wear expensive dhotis. He had said that ashrams were prisons and that they caused attachment to creep back into the minds of sadhus, who were supposed to have cleansed the mind of attachment. Maharajji had said that he had run away from the ashrams and that he’d never return.

Since that day I am confirmed that he is with me.\n\nYou and I have some thoughts, and a third person fulfills them. How is it possible? That power is working. The sadhu hardly looked twenty-one or twenty-two years old. He last came ten days ago, in the morning. A great fire was raging out of control and I was rushing down the path when he came walking up. He sat in my office and I called for tea. I told him about the fire and even though the smoke could be seen from the house, he wouldn’t allow me to go.\n\nI told the sadhu that Maharajji used to behave like this. He bowed his head and smiled. I thought that most likely he was Maharajji and that’s why he was smiling. I told him that I had to go to the fire, but he wouldn’t give me permission. Then he told me, “I have sent Pawanasuta (red name of Hanuman) there. He will control it. Hanumanji is there. Don’t worry.” About twenty-five minutes later the fire was extinguished. He said, “You can go if you want, but the fire is out.” I went to the fire and he went another way. The fire was out.\n\nPrior to that day he had come before the Kumbha Mela, after which he had told me that I’d get darshan. He wore Hanumanji’s red clothes—one dhoti and a small blanket. I told him that if Maharajji would give me darshan, he would have to tell me that it is he. Maharajji, I said, had never kept anything secret from me. I finally made my implication clear and the sadhu said, “Everything is being done under his orders.” If it is he, he should make it clear.",

He looked to be about sixty years old and very tall, over six feet. I stayed in Kainchi for some time and felt faith that somehow I would get a ride back to Nainital. Maharajji brought me to Kainchi and he would care for my return. At the gate I got a ride in a white car. Less than two miles up the road I saw a tall sadhu. I stopped the car and touched the baba’s feet, saying nothing. The baba said, “We didn’t meet at the temple and so we have met here.” I enjoined the baba to come to Nainital, and, despite his protests of much business on the plains, he came. That evening at my home the baba asked a young boy if the boy recognized him, but he didn’t wait for an answer and went on talking.

    "content": "One night three of the workers at the ashram stayed up late talking about Maharajji. Around midnight they went to sleep. K slept on the verandah of the Hanuman temple, the chaukidar across from Maharajji’s room, and the cook outside the kitchen.\n\nSome time after 1:00 A.M., the chaukidar was awakened by crying sounds—a male voice—inside Maharajji’s room. Yet the room was locked from the outside. He was very frightened and so ran to K for help. K was in a deep sleep and only after they had poured cold water on his face did he awaken. K said he felt, upon awakening, as though he had the strength of fifty men. They told him of the crying sounds and he felt completely calm as they were telling him. He said that as he stood outside the locked room, listening to the sounds, he felt no fear whatsoever—he knew with his whole being that it was all right. He felt that inside that room was Hanuman (which to K is synonymous with Maharajji). So they didn’t unlock the door to look inside.\n\nNOW MAHARAJJI comes in visions to many of the devotees.\n\nThere was a fairly wealthy man in Gujarat. He gave all his money away to his daughters, came to Vrindaban, saw the Hanuman murti, and said, “I’m never going to leave here.” He became a cook in the ashram. He was the most sincere, simple man imaginable, working from early in the morning until late at night, scrubbing and cooking. He had never seen Maharajji but was deeply devoted to him and told one of the Westerners that several times he had seen Maharajji (in a transcendent form) in the ashram.\n\nOne such time it had been late at night and he was still working in the kitchen. When he had finally finished his work, he just felt like sitting for a while before the samadhi. While he was sitting there, he felt someone tap him on the shoulder. Turning to see who it was, he beheld Maharajji standing behind him, wearing a blanket but glowing in radiant white light. He fell down at Maharajji’s feet, and Maharajji touched him and made him cry. He said that there were two other occasions when Maharajji had come to him in this way. As this man was telling the story, he was crying and went over to the spot on the ashram grounds where he saw Maharajji. “He was right here! I saw him right here.”",

When she returned outside he had vanished, but she was still in such ecstasy that she went over to the temple and wrote “Om Ram” on the wall of the samadhi building.

He was surrounded by devotees who were massaging his feet, laughing and talking about this and that, and sharing fruit and sweets. As I watched, the scene suddenly appeared to become static, as if I were watching a tableau. I felt a remoteness from it all. In my mind I thought, “My relationship with Maharajji is not in time and space. I don’t need to be at his feet in physical form. It wouldn’t really matter if I were to never see him again. He is in my heart.” Just the thought made me feel guilty, but at that moment it all came back to life and I saw Maharajji turn and whisper to an old Indian devotee standing at his side.

Maharajji said, ‘Ram Dass and I understand each other perfectly. His heart is open.’” At that very moment I knew that Maharajji had freed me from attachment to his form.

Later, as we discussed this, one of the Mothers told me that Maharajji had said, “When a saint leaves his body, the temple becomes his body.”\n\nThis year when I walked back into his room in Vrindaban, just as I crossed over the threshold, I felt as though everything I’d done in the last four years was irrelevant and meaningless. It was the same experience as having one of Maharajji’s glances—it would bring you to right here, right now.",

I’ve read this in the scriptures, of course, but this was the experience—reexperience, I should say—that when you turn your heart totally to God, everything is forgiven; it is absolutely nothing. And that’s what I felt when I went in there. I just sat for a long time in Maharajji’s room. It felt as though the shakti from Maharajji’s tucket were pouring off the blanket and into my heart, as if I were literally bathing in it, drinking the coolness of it.",

People who never knew him when he was embodied also report seeing him in visions and dreams, sensing his presence, and feeling that they are called by him. Obviously his ability to touch people is not limited by physical contact.\n\nWHEN PEOPLE THINK ON ME, I AM WITH THEM.\n\nThere is no way to generalize how it has been for the devotees since Maharajji left his body. Each of us has gone on with life. Some of us cling to the memories of the form, the stories, the photographs, the rituals, the names, and each other. Others among us have let the form go, knowing that we need not necessarily cling to Maharajji, because he clings so strongly to us that, even if we tried, we could not forget. The legacy that he has left each person who acknowledges his existence is a faith deep within the heart. He reawakened that faith through mirroring for us a place in ourselves so deep that we rarely, if ever, had touched it before. It is a place of light, in which we truly share the brilliant, wondrous loving-living spirit. And seeing such a light has made it all different.\n\nBefore I met Maharajji I was doing the same things I do now but out of orbit. He got me into orbit.",

One friend invited me to see the cinema in Nainital. I said, “Why? I have seen the biggest cinema here. That Nainital cinema will bore me. The biggest entertainment is Maharajji.”\n\nBy leaving us with so few guidelines that are free of confusion, so few practices, he has protected us from getting caught in more superficial levels of our being. For example, we cannot hide in righteousness, because he was a rascal—nor can we hide in rascality, because his every act was dharmic. In no form can our egos hide, for Maharajji is always there, like Hanuman, to “spot a tyrant and pull his beard.”\n\nSometimes I have flashes of it. I keep a couple of little pictures of Maharajji around the house. Every once in a while, when I’m rushing through things—like I’ll get up late and have to rush to work, so I’ll go speeding through the house—every once in a while he’ll jump out and grab me. Either I’ll see the picture and I’ll think, “Whooo, right! Don’t worry, I still remember,” or I won’t see the picture but I’ll have some kind of flash, like, “What are you doing? What’s happening? Are you still there? Where are you? What’s happening?”",
